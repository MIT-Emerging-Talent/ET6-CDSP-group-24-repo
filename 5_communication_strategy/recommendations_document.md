# Targeted Solutions for Driving Digital Inclusion

## Solutions for Coordinators at Disability Inclusion Organisations

### 1. Bridging Affordability & Access Gaps

- Establish device libraries and recycling programs: Create shared resources for
   expensive assistive technologies, allowing members to borrow rather than purchase
- Develop group purchasing cooperatives: Leverage collective bargaining power to
  negotiate discounted rates on devices, data plans, and assistive technologies
- Create accessibility certification programs: Train and certify local
 technicians to repair and maintain assistive devices, reducing long-term costs

### 2. Building Skills & Capacity

- Design peer-to-peer training networks: Formalize informal mentorship
 structures identified in findings (like Urumuri Association model)
- Develop localized digital literacy curriculum: Create training materials in
  local languages with disability-specific modules
- Establish "train the trainer" programs: Build capacity within disability
 communities to sustain knowledge transfer

### 3. Advocacy & Representation

- Form disability advisory boards: Create formal structures to advise tech
  companies and telecoms on accessibility needs
- Document and share success stories: Collect evidence of effective inclusive
 solutions to demonstrate feasibility and impact
- Lead participatory design workshops: Ensure PWDs are directly involved in
 creating and testing digital solutions

## Solutions for Program Officers in NGOs

### 1. Program Design & Implementation

- Integrate digital inclusion across all programs: Move beyond siloed approaches
   to build digital access into education, livelihood, and health initiatives
- Develop intersectional programming: Create targeted initiatives for multiply
  marginalized groups (e.g., rural women with disabilities)
- Implement mobile-friendly solutions: Design programs that work with low data
 usage (<100MB/month) identified in findings

### 2. Partnerships & Resource Development

- Build cross-sector consortia: Coordinate with telecoms, government agencies,
 and disability organizations for comprehensive solutions
- Develop social enterprise models: Create sustainable funding streams through
 device refurbishment, accessible tech support services, or digital skills training
- Establish community technology hubs: Create physical spaces with accessible
 devices, connectivity, and training in underserved areas

### 3. Monitoring & Evaluation

- Implement disability-disaggregated data collection: Fix the data invisibility
 issue by developing robust methodologies for tracking digital inclusion outcomes
- Create accessibility audit tools: Develop simple frameworks for assessing
 digital accessibility of services and platforms
- Document and address stigma barriers: Include specific metrics on stigma
 reduction in program evaluations

## Solutions for Advocacy Leads in Philanthropic Foundations

### 1. Strategic Funding Priorities

- Establish inclusive tech innovation funds: Provide seed funding for startups
 developing accessible technologies with African language support
- Fund disability-led organizations: Direct resources to organizations led by
 PWDs to address representation gaps
- Support policy implementation mechanisms: Fund accountability systems,
 monitoring frameworks, and enforcement mechanisms for existing digital
 inclusion laws

### 2. Systems Change Initiatives

- Convene cross-sector dialogues: Bring together telecoms, government,
 disability organizations, and tech companies to develop coordinated strategies
- Support accessibility standards development: Fund creation and promotion of
 accessibility standards tailored to local contexts
- Invest in disability data infrastructure: Support improved methodologies for
 collecting and analyzing disability-disaggregated data

### 3. Advocacy & Thought Leadership

- Develop economic case for inclusion: Fund research demonstrating ROI of
 digital inclusion for PWDs to influence private sector investment
- Support public awareness campaigns: Address stigma and discrimination,
 particularly for rural women with disabilities
- Create learning communities: Establish platforms for sharing effective
 practices and lessons learned across grantees and sectors

## Cross-Cutting Recommendations
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 MD013 MD041-->
1. Adopt "Nothing About Us Without Us" principle: Ensure PWDs are meaningfully involved in all stages of program design, implementation, and evaluation
2. Address intersectionality explicitly: Design solutions that recognize how disability intersects with gender, geography, and poverty
3. Leverage informal networks: Recognize and support the community-based solutions already bridging gaps left by formal systems
4. Focus on sustainability: Move beyond pilot projects to systemic solutions that can be maintained and scaled
5. Measure what matters: Develop metrics that go beyond simple access to measure actual usage, benefit, and impact
