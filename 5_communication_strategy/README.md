# Communication Strategy

## Who We Are Reaching

Our primary audience includes three groups who can directly influence digital
inclusion outcomes:

* **Coordinators at disability inclusion organizations** – Leading grassroots
  advocacy and economic empowerment for people with disabilities.

* **Program officers in NGOs** – Implementing livelihood programs and digital
  inclusion initiatives.

* **Advocacy leads in philanthropic foundations** – Funding disability-inclusive
 technology and policy reform, **alongside influencers and journalists** who
 amplify these narratives to shape public discourse and drive systemic change.

These are busy, values-driven people. They care about results, rely on evidence,
 and need clear signals about what to fund, amplify, or apply.

We also draw on fully developed personas(see the [personas file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mXBrXFIjiWoPmoncIxT8Cb0hygaCoyf7FueW2WxPvKU/edit?gid=1146215922#gid=1146215922))
 to shape our tone, format, and outreach.
 For example:

> Grace, a regional DPO coordinator, works across urban and rural settings with
limited staff—juggling advocacy, training, and direct support. She empowers
local members via WhatsApp and PDFs, influences policy when possible, yet often
lacks accessible, concise research she can share quickly. Anchoring our strategy
 in real profiles like hers keeps our outreach practical, relevant, and grounded
  in lived realities.

### What We're Saying

Our core message: Digital systems must work for everyone—including disabled
entrepreneurs in Sub-Saharan Africa. We communicate this through:

1. **Human-centered storytelling** - Using real narratives, like Vivian’s
   experience with an inaccessible banking app, makes the barriers tangible
   while keeping our message credible. These stories are chosen to reflect
   common patterns our research uncovered, not just isolated incidents.

2. **Evidence-based barriers** – Six recurring structural issues surfaced in our
    mixed-methods research:

    * Connectivity gaps despite network coverage

    * Affordability challenges for devices, assistive tech, and data

    * Exclusionary design (poor screen reader compatibility, etc.)

    * Persistent digital skills gaps

    * Weak policy implementation

    * Stigma and discrimination

3. **Tailored solutions** – Clear, actionable recommendations linked to specific
    stakeholder roles. For example, NGO program officers can integrate
    accessibility into funding criteria, while DPO coordinators can adapt our
    barrier summaries into locally relevant formats.
    For a full breakdown of tailored solutions and actionable recommendations,
please refer to our detailed [recommendation documents](./recommendations_documents.md).

4. **Clear calls to action** - Inviting engagement through downloading the full
   report, sharing the findings, and potential collaboration.

### Why

We’re saying this because right now, disabled entrepreneurs across Sub-Saharan
Africa—part of a much larger community of millions of disabled people—are being
locked out of the very systems that power today’s economy. Our research,
combining lived experience with both qualitative and NLP analysis, shows how
design flaws, high costs, and systemic gaps turn “access” into an empty promise.
 If decision-makers have clear evidence, grounded in real-world stories, they
 can fund, advocate for, and help shape digital systems that work for everyone
 from the start. Our strategy is about turning awareness into action, and
 action into systemic change—so that inclusion becomes the norm, not the exception.

### Our Artifact

Our main public artifact is the [**Offline by Design landing page**](https://offlinebydesign.site/#)
—built as the
narrative gateway to our full research. It brings together:

* Human stories (like Vivian’s) woven together with evidence on each key barrier

* Solutions mapped to stakeholder roles for immediate use

* Research distilled into accessible, compelling formats

From there, people can explore our open repository, which houses:

* Manual and NLP analysis outputs

* Datasets and source materials

* Recommendations in depth

### Our Sharing Strategy

To reach those who can act on this, we’re:

* Beginning to share across professional and advocacy networks (LinkedIn,
   Twitter/X, Instagram)  
* Planning targeted posts in disability inclusion, tech, and policy forums  
* Developing partner-friendly materials so stories and insights can be adapted
  and shared locally  
* Conducting targeted email outreach to our key personas, which will include:  
  * Cold emailing direct contacts identified through professional networks
  (e.g. LinkedIn)  
  * Personalizing messages to reference their work or organizational priorities
  * Linking directly to our landing page and downloadable report

This approach directly supports our Milestone 4 goal: moving from research to
communication that sparks action—getting our findings into the hands of the
people best placed to drive inclusive change.
