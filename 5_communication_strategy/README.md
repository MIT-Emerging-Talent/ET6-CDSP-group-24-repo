# Summary of Strategy

## Who We Are Reaching

Our audience spans the people and organisations with the ability to drive or
demand systemic change in accessibility and inclusion.

### System-level decision-makers

* Program officers in NGOs
* Coordinators at disability inclusion organisations
* Advocacy leads in rights-based movements
* Philanthropic programme managers
* Corporate heads of diversity, equity, and inclusion

### Narrative shapers & influencers

* Journalists and editors
* Content creators and storytellers
* Media professionals covering disability rights, digital equity, and accessibility

### Community & public stakeholders

* Grassroots organisers
* Disabled persons’ organisations
* Activists and campaigners
* Concerned individuals working toward a more inclusive digital future

By design, our reach is both broad and deep, from those with the authority to
change systems, to those shaping public understanding, to those living the
realities our work addresses.

We also draw on fully developed personas to shape our tone, format, and outreach.

**Meet one of our targets:**  
Grace — Regional DPO Coordinator  
She works across urban and rural areas with a small team, juggling advocacy,
training, and direct support. Most days she's empowering local members via
WhatsApp, or pushing for meaningful policy changes. What she often lacks is
accessible, concise research she can share quickly. Building our strategy around
 people like her keeps our outreach practical, relevant, and grounded in lived
  realities.

## What We Are Saying

Our core message: Digital systems must work for everyone—including disabled
entrepreneurs in Sub-Saharan Africa.

We communicate this by:

1. **Human-centered storytelling** - Sharing real accounts, like Vivian's
   experience with an inaccessible banking app, to make barriers visible while
   keeping our message credible. These stories reflect common patterns our
   research uncovered, not just isolated incidents.
2. **Evidence-based barriers** – Presenting six recurring structural issues
   surfaced in our mixed-methods research:
   * Connectivity gaps despite network coverage
   * High costs for devices, assistive tech, and data
   * Exclusionary design (poor screen reader compatibility, etc.)
   * Persistent digital skills gaps
   * Weak policy implementation
   * Stigma and discrimination
3. **Tailored solutions** - Offering actionable recommendations tailored to
   specific stakeholder group based on our research findings.For a full
   breakdown of tailored solutions and actionable recommendations,
please refer to our detailed [recommendation documents](./recommendations_documents.md).

4. **Clear calls to action** - Inviting engagement through report downloads,
   sharing findings, and potential collaboration.

## Why

Our message is urgent because:

* The digital divide is widening for disabled entrepreneurs in SSA – As digital
  systems become the default for banking, commerce, and communication,
exclusionary design and affordability barriers are locking out millions,
entrenching economic inequality.
* Policy and rhetoric aren't matching lived reality – While governments and
  organisations promote "digital inclusion," our research reveals persistent
gaps between coverage and actual use, between legal commitments and real-world accessibility.
* Solutions exist, but aren't reaching the people who need them – Assistive
  technology, inclusive design practices, and targeted training can close these
gaps, but adoption is slow without pressure from informed stakeholders.
* We have evidence that can catalyze change – Our mixed-methods research
  captures both lived experiences and structural data, providing credible
  insights that stakeholders can use to prioritize, fund, and implement solutions.

## Our Artifact

Our main public artifact is the Offline by Design landing page—built as the
narrative gateway to our full research.

It brings together:

* Human stories (like Vivian's) woven together with evidence on each key barrier
* Solutions mapped to stakeholder roles for immediate use
* Research distilled into accessible, compelling formats

From there, people can explore our open repository, which houses:

* [The full methodology](../4_data_analysis/)
* [NLP and qualitative analysis outputs](../4_data_analysis/mixed_methods_findings.md)
* [Datasets and source materials](../1_datasets/)
* [Recommendations in depth](./recommendations_document.md)

## Our Sharing Strategy

To reach those who can act on this, we're:
→ Beginning to share across professional and advocacy networks (LinkedIn,
Twitter/X, Instagram)  
→ Planning targeted posts in disability inclusion, tech, and policy forums  
→ Developing partner-friendly materials so stories and insights can be adapted
and shared locally  
→ Conducting targeted email outreach to our key personas. This will include:  

* Cold emailing direct contacts identified through professional networks (e.g,
 LinkedIn)  
* Personalizing messages to reference their work or organizational priorities  
* Linking directly to our landing page and downloadable report
