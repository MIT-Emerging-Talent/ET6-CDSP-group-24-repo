# Domain Study README

## Overview

This folder contains research materials to explore the problem domain, identify
key challenges, and guide the project's direction. It serves as a knowledge
base to understand the context, background review, and research notes.

## Research Process

We mapped our individual interests and converged on economic inclusion, with
focus on entrepreneurship and digital access.

Each team member conducted an independent literature review
[see literature reviews](./research_notes/literature_review/) and
[proposed initial questions](./research_notes/initial_research_questions.md).

Synthesis revealed shared interest in how tech shapes access and opportunity for
marginalized entrepreneurs, especially those with disabilities.

## Our Research Question

How do digital technologies exclude self-employed people with
disabilities in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)?

### Defining Our Scope

For this project, ‚Äúself-employed people‚Äù refers broadly to those who
generate income independently‚Äîfreelancers, gig workers, small traders, and
owners of small businesses, both formal and informal.

We recognize that many such individuals also identify as entrepreneurs building
growth-oriented ventures. Both terms appear in our materials, but
‚Äúself-employed people‚Äù serves as our core focus throughout the project when
analyzing digital inclusion and exclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

## Purpose

The domain study aims to:

- Establish a thorough understanding of the problem domain
- Identify existing solutions and their limitations
- Complete research process documentation
- Uncover research gaps and opportunities
- Provide insights to guide project direction
- Create a knowledge base for team members and stakeholders
