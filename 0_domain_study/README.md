# Domain Study README

## Overview

This folder contains research materials to explore the problem domain, identify
key challenges, and guide the project's direction. It serves as a knowledge
base to understand the context, background review, and research notes.

## Research Process

We mapped our individual interests and converged on economic inclusion, with
focus on entrepreneurship and digital access.

Each team member conducted an independent literature review
[see literature reviews](0_domain_study/literature_reviews) and
[proposed initial questions](0_domain_study/initial_research_questions.md).

Synthesis revealed shared interest in how tech shapes access and opportunity for
marginalized entrepreneurs, especially those with disabilities.

Conceptual Flow:
