### **The Research Question**  

To what extent have tailored mentorship programs and business development
services enhanced the market access of disabled entrepreneurs, leading to
measurable improvements in their business performance over the last 10 years?

#### **Why this question is well-suited for evaluation:**

- **Tailored mentorship programs and business development services:** The
  effectiveness of these interventions can be assessed through participant
  surveys, attendance records, and feedback mechanisms.
- **Market access:** This can be evaluated by tracking metrics such as the
  number of new markets entered, distribution channels established, or changes
  in customer base.
- **Business performance:** This can be measured through objective financial
  indicators like revenue growth, profit margins, job creation, and business
  survival rates, as well as qualitative assessments of business stability and
  sustainability.
- **Disabled people and entrepreneurs for specific time:** There are several
  resources where you can find datasets related to disabled people and
  information on disabled entrepreneurs.

### **Research Question**

How can local-language AI chatbots—deployed via scalable platforms (e.g.,
WhatsApp, Android, cloud APIs)—drive measurable revenue growth for
microbusinesses in underserved markets of Kenya, while creating downstream
monetization opportunities for big tech through data, payments, and ecosystem lock-in?

#### **Why?**

- **Profit Alignment:** Directly links to revenue streams big tech cares about
  (data, payments, market expansion).
- **Scalability:** Targets Kenya first but implies replicability in other
  Swahili-speaking markets (e.g., Tanzania, Uganda).
- **Tech Angle:** Involves AI localization, platform integration (WhatsApp/
  Android), and emerging market data—all hot areas.
- **Social Impact Bonus:** Frames big tech as empowering microbusinesses
  (good for PR/ESG reports).

#### **Business Use Cases**

- Boost revenue growth by helping microbusinesses reach customers, automate
  sales, and access financial tools (e.g., digital payments).
- Improve operational efficiency by providing low-cost customer support,
  inventory management, and market insights in the user’s native language.
- Enhance customer engagement by enabling hyper-localized, conversational
  interactions (e.g., voice-based commerce for illiterate users).

#### **Who Benefits?**

- Micro Businesses in Kenya (Direct Beneficiaries)  
- Big Tech Companies (Meta, Google, Microsoft, etc.)  
- Government & Development Agencies

**Mapping Inclusion: Can AI Predict Mentorship Impact for Disabled Entrepreneurs
 in Pakistan?**

*Using Interpretable Machine Learning to Personalize Support for
Underserved Microbusinesses*

### **Option 1: Research Question**

How can machine learning models identify which disabled micro-entrepreneurs
benefit most from virtual mentorship programs, based on their digital access,
business stage, and psychosocial readiness?

#### **Alternatives**

- Which factors most strongly predict mentorship success among disabled
  entrepreneurs in low-access regions, and how can ML personalize support delivery?
- How interpretable AI can be used to deliver the right support—like mentorship
  and financial tools—to underserved micro-entrepreneurs, ensuring resources go
  where they're needed most and inclusion is intentional, not accidental.
- Can AI-driven matching models improve business outcomes for disabled
  entrepreneurs by optimizing mentor–mentee pairings based on digital readiness
  and inclusion barriers?
- What profiles of disabled micro-entrepreneurs are most likely to benefit
  from remote mentorship, and how can interpretable ML be used to inform
  inclusive program design?
- How can ML models identify which entrepreneurs with mobility impairments
  benefit most from virtual mentorship programs, based on digital access,
  business stage, and psychosocial readiness?
- How can ML models predict which early-stage disabled micro-entrepreneurs are
  most likely to benefit from virtual mentorship, based on digital
  infrastructure, psychosocial readiness, and access to business development support?
- How can interpretable ML models help predict which semi-digitally connected
  disabled entrepreneurs benefit from virtual mentorship programs in rural areas?

#### **Abstract**  

Disabled entrepreneurs in Pakistan face layered barriers to economic inclusion—
including limited access to mentorship, digital tools, and formal business
networks. While virtual mentorship programs have emerged to bridge these gaps,
there is limited understanding of which individuals benefit most and under what
conditions. This study leverages interpretable machine learning models (e.g.,
decision trees, SHAP analysis) to predict mentorship impact based on variables
such as business maturity, internet access, disability type, and psychological
readiness. By identifying inclusion profiles and success predictors, the research
aims to support policymakers and program designers in targeting high-impact,
equity-focused interventions for disabled entrepreneurs.

#### **Next Steps to Finalize**

- **Geographic Focus:** Pakistan, India, Kenya (check dataset access)  
- **Define Mentorship Impact:** Choose 1–2 outcomes: e.g., business survival,
  digital adoption, or self-efficacy  
- **Key Features for Model:** Disability type, digital access, business stage,
  psychosocial readiness, geography  
- **Model Approach:** Use decision trees/logistic regression + SHAP for
  interpretability  
- **Data Sources:** Explore Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, ILO, Grameen
  Foundation, or local incubators  
- **Validation Plan:** Apply cross-validation; compare baseline; consult real
  implementers (if possible)

>**Trendiness**: The use of AI to personalize virtual support for disabled micro-entrepreneurs
>is a hot topic—especially in post-COVID entrepreneurship support systems.

**Beyond Access: Can AI Spot the Next Successful Women-Led Microbusiness in
Pakistan or Kenya, etc.?**  

*A Predictive Model on Digital Tools, Mobile Money & Inclusion Outcomes*

### **Option 2: Research Question**  

How can interpretable machine learning models predict the success and digital
inclusion of women-led microenterprises based on mobile money usage, digital
access, and rural-urban context?

#### Abstract

Access to digital tools and financial services has become a defining factor in
the success of microenterprises, particularly for women entrepreneurs in
underserved regions. However, gaps in infrastructure, digital literacy, and
systemic gender disparities continue to limit inclusive economic participation.
This study investigates how interpretable machine learning models can be used to
predict entrepreneurial success and digital inclusion outcomes among women-led
microenterprises, with a specific focus on variables such as mobile money usage,
digital access, and geographic context (rural vs. urban). By using transparent
modeling approaches (e.g., decision trees and SHAP values), the study aims not
only to generate accurate predictions but also to surface actionable insights
for policymakers and support programs. The goal is to design data-driven tools
that help identify which women entrepreneurs are most at risk of exclusion and
where targeted interventions—digital training, access to finance, or
infrastructure support—could have the greatest impact.

#### **Next Steps**

- Choose a specific country or region for data availability  
- Decide on a clear definition of "success" (e.g., 2-year survival,
  formalization, access to credit)  
- Define model type: decision tree, logistic regression + SHAP  
- Clarify dataset sources: e.g., National enterprise surveys, microfinance orgs,
  etc.

### **My Research Question**

How can artificial intelligence be used to reduce traditional barriers in
accessing financing for entrepreneurs in Sudan?

#### **Why this question works well:**

- **Artificial intelligence interventions:** The use of AI tools like credit
  scoring algorithms, risk assessment models, and automated loan processing can
  be assessed through data on loan approval rates, processing times, and error/
  fraud detection rates.
- **Traditional barriers:** These include lack of credit history, collateral
  requirements, and bureaucratic delays. Their reduction can be evaluated by
  comparing loan accessibility metrics before and after AI adoption.
- **Access to financing:** This can be measured by the number of entrepreneurs
  receiving loans, loan sizes, and diversity of recipients (e.g., gender, location).
- **Entrepreneurs in Sudan:** The focus population includes small and medium
  enterprises (SMEs) and individual entrepreneurs across different regions in Sudan.
