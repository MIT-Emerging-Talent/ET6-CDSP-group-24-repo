# Overview of the theme: Economic Inclusion

Lack of funding and financial services for entrepreneurs, especially SMEs,
creates a major barrier to economic inclusion. It limits the ability of
individuals—particularly from underserved populations—to start, sustain,
or grow businesses.

## Key Terms, Metrics, and Indicators

* **Financial Inclusion Rate:** The percentage of those who have access to and use
    formal financial services like banks or mobile money.
* **SME Loan Rejection Rate:** The proportion of small and medium enterprises that
    are denied credit when applying for loans.
* **Credit Gap for SMEs:** The total difference between the financing that SMEs need
    and what they actually receive from financial institutions.
* **Gender Finance Gap:** The difference in access to credit and financial services
    between men and women, especially among entrepreneurs.
* **Mobile Money Account Usage:** The share of the population actively using
    mobile-based financial services for transactions and savings.

## Populations Commonly Affected

* Youth entrepreneurs (often under 35)
* Women-led businesses
* Rural populations
* Persons with disabilities
* Micro and informal businesses

## Existing Challenges

### Barriers

* **Lack of Credit History or Collateral:** Many low-income individuals and
    micro-entrepreneurs cannot access loans because they have no formal financial
    records or assets to secure credit.
* **High Interest Rates:** Microloans often come with interest rates ranging from
    20–40%, making them difficult to repay and creating risk of debt cycles.
* **Limited Formal Banking in Rural Areas:** Rural communities often lack physical
    banks or financial institutions, reducing access to financial services and digital
    tools.

### Systems-Level Factors

* **Policy Gaps in SME Support and Credit Guarantees:** Many countries lack
    comprehensive policies or government-backed guarantee programs to support
    small businesses.

* Improve policies for crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending.
* Design products for informal and underserved communities.
* Enhance financial literacy and digital skills.
* Build partnerships between fintech and traditional banks.
