# Overview of the theme: Economic Inclusion

Lack of funding and financial services for entrepreneurs, especially SMEs,
creates a major barrier to economic inclusion. It limits the ability of
individuals—particularly from underserved populations—to start, sustain,
or grow businesses

## **Key terms, metrics, indicators**

- Financial inclusion rate: The percentage of those who have access to and use
formal financial services like banks or mobile money.
- SME loan rejection rate: The proportion of small and medium enterprises that
are denied credit when applying for loans.
- Credit gap for SMEs: The total difference between the financing that SMEs need
and what they actually receive from financial institutions
- Gender finance gap: The difference in access to credit and financial services
between men and women, especially among entrepreneurs
- Mobile money account usage: The share of the population actively using
mobile-based financial services for transactions and savings

## Populations Commonly affected

- Youth entrepreneurs (often under 35)
- Women-led businesses
- Rural populations
- Persons with disabilities
- Micro and informal businesses

## Existing Challenges

### Barriers

- Lack of credit history or collateral: Many low-income individuals and
micro-entrepreneurs cannot access loans because they have no formal financial
records or assets to secure credit.
- High interest rates: Microloans often come with interest rates ranging from
20–40%, making them difficult to repay and creating risk of debt cycles.
- Limited formal banking in rural areas: Rural communities often lack physical
banks or financial institutions, reducing access to financial services and digital
tools.

### Systems-Level Factors

Policy gaps in SME support and credit guarantees: Many countries lack
comprehensive policies or government-backed guarantee programs to support small businesses.
