# Overview of the theme: Economic Inclusion

Economic inclusion for persons with disabilities (PWDs) means ensuring their
full participation in economic activities, including access to labor markets,
entrepreneurship, financial services, and social protection, thereby enabling
them to move out of poverty and achieve sustainable livelihoods. It goes beyond
basic subsistence to encompass empowerment, productivity, and choice.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 1.3 billion
people worldwide—about 16% of the global population or roughly 1 in 6
people—experience significant disability.
Entrepreneurship for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs)
Entrepreneurship offers PWDs an alternative pathway to overcome barriers in
traditional employment, providing flexibility, autonomy, and income generation.
Entrepreneurship enables bypassing workplace discrimination and accommodation
challenges, promoting self-reliance and economic participation.

## **Key Terms and Metrics**

Entrepreneurship and Self-Employment as Drivers:
PWDs have higher self-employment rates (12–15%) compared to non-disabled peers
(~9%), reflecting both opportunity and necessity due to labor market exclusion.

- Legal and Policy Frameworks:

Policy support is often insufficient or poorly targeted, limiting growth
opportunities for PWD entrepreneurs. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities (CRPD) mandates accessible financial services and inclusive
development programs, emphasizing entrepreneurship as a key inclusion strategy.

- Disability Benefits:

Receiving disability benefits does not significantly motivate entrepreneurship,
indicating other factors drive business creation4.

- Labor Force Participation:

Overall labor participation is lower for PWDs; many turn to entrepreneurship as
an alternative to formal employment barriers15.

- Digital Assistive Technologies:

Flexible work arrangements and assistive technologies have been key enablers,
especially post-pandemic56

- Business Size and Turnover:

Disabled-owned businesses tend to be smaller and contribute less to turnover,
indicating challenges in scaling8.

- Industry Distribution:

PWD entrepreneurs operate across diverse sectors including agriculture, crafts,
consulting, and services, without significant sectoral concentration2.

- Remote Work Adoption:

Higher adoption of remote work among PWD entrepreneurs reflects adaptation to
accessibility and flexibility needs.

- Resilience and Motivation:

Psychological traits such as resilience, tolerance to uncertainty,
and persistence positively influence entrepreneurial intention among PWDs.

- Social Capital and Living Situation:

Factors like living arrangements and social support networks impact
entrepreneurship likelihood.

- Some Data Points

In the U.S., the employment rate for disabled adults is 46.5% compared to 79.6%
for non-disabled peers3.
Employment among blind and visually impaired adults is approximately 32–37%,
with better outcomes linked to higher education and braille literacy67.
Nearly 1-in-4 entrepreneurs starting businesses in 2023 reported having a
disability, with many citing technology and flexibility as key enablers.

### Populations commonly affected

- Geographic Disparities

Economic exclusion is particularly severe in developing countries and rural
areas due to poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and policy gaps that limit
access to entrepreneurial opportunities and support services. For example,
in parts of Africa, only 17.9% of individuals with self-care disabilities are
employed, reflecting limited access to economic activities (ILO, 2023).

- Gender Intersections

Women with disabilities face compounded barriers including higher unemployment
rates, cultural stigma, and caregiving responsibilities. Disability incidence
rates among women aged 65–69 can be nearly double those of men, increasing their
economic vulnerability. This disparity is not fully explained by age or access
to services but is linked to social and cultural factors.14
Women with visual impairments are less likely to be employed than men with
similar impairments, compounding economic vulnerability.4 Despite these
challenges, data on entrepreneurship by gender remains limited,
highlighting a critical gap in research and policy (UK Government, 2024).

- Disability Type and Severity

Employment and entrepreneurial participation vary widely by disability type.
For instance, individuals with hearing impairments have higher employment rates
(~59.4%) compared to those with self-care disabilities (~17.9%).
Visually impaired entrepreneurs face unique challenges related to technology
accessibility, assistive devices, and digital literacy. Those with severe or
very severe impairments experience greater economic exclusion and incur
additional costs, such as for assistive technologies and healthcare,
which further limit their economic participation (BLS, 2024).

- Age Groups

Entrepreneurship is more common among working-age PWDs than non-disabled peers,
yet older adults with disabilities often encounter increased exclusion due to
health decline and age-related discrimination. Early onset of vision loss
negatively affects educational attainment and long-term economic prospects.
Younger visually impaired individuals face barriers entering the labor market,
while older adults struggle to maintain employment or grow businesses (National
Disability Institute, 2023).

- Socioeconomic Status and Ethnicity

Economic exclusion disproportionately affects PWDs from low-income households
and marginalized ethnic or racial groups. Visually impaired persons in low- and
middle-income countries—especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and East
Asia—are more likely to live in poverty due to limited access to inclusive
services and economic opportunities. Intersectional factors such as race and
gender intensify exclusion, with Black women among the visually impaired facing
some of the most severe poverty and unemployment (Brookings Institution, 2022).

### Existing challenges

- Financial exclusion: Disabled entrepreneurs face rejection and are 400 times
less likely to attract investment than non-disabled peers8. Banks often perceive
people with disabilities (PWDs) as high-risk, forcing reliance on predatory lenders.
- Lack of tailored support: Scarcity of programs addressing unique needs hinders
business growth.
- Discrimination and stigma: Workplace discrimination pushes many toward
entrepreneurship but also limits access to networks and resources58. Stigma
frames disability as a "punishment" in some cultures, deterring disclosure and
participation5. Inaccessible ICT designs and non-adapted communication tools
perpetuate exclusion.
- Digital inequity: In Africa, 80% of PWDs lack access to assistive technologies
due to cost and infrastructural gaps6, restricting their ability to engage in
digital entrepreneurship.
- Additional disability-related costs: Average extra monthly costs exceed $1,300,
impacting reinvestment ability.
- Data invisibility: Disability data is often missing from business surveys,
making PWD entrepreneurs invisible in policy and program planning.
- Scaling difficulties: Disabled-owned businesses contribute disproportionately
less to overall economic turnover.
Lack of market information and marketing skills: Ranked as a top challenge, this
limits business growth and competitiveness.
- Policy shortcomings: Enforcement of disability-inclusive policies and digital
accessibility standards is inconsistent, especially in low- and middle-income
countries. Many countries fail to align with SDGs like Goal 8
(decent work for all).
- Health issues and excessive tensions: These affect the ability to sustain
entrepreneurial activities.

Led by the University of Technology Sydney, the NDDA integrates multiple
administrative datasets on disability services, education, employment,
and health to enable evidence-based policymaking and program design.
This large-scale data integration supports social inclusion and economic
participation of PWDs, including entrepreneurship (UTS, 2022).

- Data-Driven Entrepreneurship Strategies for PWDs
  
A doctoral study analyzing entrepreneurs with disabilities identified key
success factors such as strong product and market knowledge, financial and
marketing relationships, and operational leadership. These data-driven insights
inform programs and policies to support sustainable entrepreneurship among PWDs (Howard,2017).

### Gaps and Opportunities

- Intersectional Approaches
  
Few programs adequately address the overlapping barriers faced by PWDs related
to gender, age, disability type, and socioeconomic status. Women with disabilities,
rural residents, and older PWDs often experience compounded exclusion,
yet interventions rarely tailor support to these intersectional realities
(FasterCapital, 2024; Hidegh et al., 2023).
Addressing these multilayered barriers is critical to developing inclusive
entrepreneurship ecosystems.

- Scalable and Replicable Models
  
Most successful interventions remain localized, lacking replicable frameworks
for digital inclusion such as affordable assistive technologies and accessible platforms.
While inspiring cases exist—like a visually impaired entrepreneur in Egypt
leveraging digital tools and strong support to grow his business—scaling and
adapting such models across diverse cultural and economic contexts remains
a challenge (Tandfonline, 2023).

- Data Granularity and Disaggregation
  
Employment and entrepreneurship metrics often lack sufficient disaggregation by
disability type, gender, age, and socioeconomic status, limiting the ability to
design targeted policies and programs. More granular, disability-disaggregated
business data is essential to identify underrepresented groups and tailor
interventions effectively (FasterCapital, 2024).

- Private Sector Engagement
  
There is limited collaboration between disability advocates and technology
companies to co-design accessible entrepreneurial platforms and services.
Engaging the private sector more deeply can accelerate innovation and improve
access to digital tools for PWD entrepreneurs (Gusto, 2024).

#### How Data Science Can Address These Gaps
