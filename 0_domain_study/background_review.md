# Background Domain Review

## 1. Introduction  

This review synthesizes research on how digital technology ecosystems
enable (or hinder) economic inclusion for persons with disabilities (PWDs), with
a focus on entrepreneurship.

**Key Themes**: Accessibility, corporate practices, gaps, barriers, innovations,
and theoretical frameworks.

---

## 2. Defining Disability and Economic Inclusion  

### 2.1 Disability  

Any physical, sensory, cognitive, or mental impairment that
limits or hinders participation in activities.

- **Global Prevalence**: 1.3 billion people (16% of the population) experience
significant disability (WHO, 2023).  

- **Intersectionality**: Disparities worsen with compounded marginalization
(e.g., gender, race, poverty).  

### 2.2 Economic Inclusion  

Full participation in economic activities, including access to labor
markets, entrepreneurship, financial services, and social protection—to
enable sustainable livelihoods and empowerment beyond basic subsistence.

- **Entrepreneurship as a Pathway**: Offers PWDs an essential alternative pathway
to overcome barriers in traditional employment. It provides flexibility, autonomy,
and income generation while bypassing workplace discrimination and accommodation
challenges.

## 3. The Role of Digital Technology

### 3.1 Components of Inclusive Digital Ecosystems  

| Key Component       | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Accessibility       | Designing products for visual, auditory,   |
|                     | cognitive and physical impairments.         |
| Inclusive Hiring    | Increasing representation of people with   |
|                     | disabilities in tech roles.                 |
| Universal Design    | Embedding accessibility features from     |
|                     | the initial design phase.                  |
| User Engagement     | Involving people with disabilities in     |
|                     | testing and feedback processes.            |
| Data Representation | Collecting and analyzing disability-      |
|                     | disaggregated data to identify barriers.   |

### 3.2 Historical and Policy Context  

- **Key Frameworks**:  

  - **The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD)** mandates
  accessibility and equal participation for persons with disabilities, emphasizing
  the removal of barriers and the promotion of full inclusion in society. It defines
  disability as resulting from the interaction between impairments and attitudinal
/ environmental barriers.

  - **The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), USA**   prohibits discrimination
  based on disability and enforces accessibility requirements, including for digital
  services and technologies.

  - **The European Accessibility Act** sets common accessibility standards for products
  and services across the European Union to improve the functioning of the
  internal market and ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities.

Historically, tech companies have often approached accessibility reactively,
implementing changes mainly after legal challenges or regulatory pressure rather
than proactively embedding inclusion. This reactive stance highlights the gap
between legal compliance and genuine, proactive disability inclusion.

---

## 4. Gaps

- **Limited Data**: Big Tech companies publish diversity, equity, and inclusion
(DEI) reports, but detailed data on disability inclusion, especially workforce
representation, remains limited.
  
- **Accessibility Gaps**: Many digital platforms, including mobile money apps
and e-commerce sites, still fall short in usability for disabled users.

- **Underrepresentation**: Disabled people are underrepresented in tech roles. Barriers
include lack of support and accessibility.

- **Global Divide**: Low-resource settings face affordability barriers (e.g.,
high-cost assistive tech).  

- **Lived Experiences**: Minimal qualitative studies on disabled entrepreneurs’
tech use.  
- **Limited Intersectional Analysis**: How disability intersects with race, gender,
and geography.
- **Longitudinal Impact**: Efficacy of accessibility tools in entrepreneurial
success.

## 6. Challenges and Barriers  

### 6.1 Systemic Barriers

- **Economic**  
  - High cost of assistive technologies
  - Uneven internet access, especially in Global South regions  
  - Disability-led startups receive less venture capital funding

- **Institutional**

  - Inconsistent enforcement of accessibility standards
  - Lack of disability-disaggregated data collection  
  - Slow adoption of universal design principles in tech education

- **Design**  
  - Incompatibility between mainstream software and assistive devices  
  - Reactive inclusion (accessibility added post-launch due to legal pressure)  

### 6.2 Cultural Barriers

- **Ableism in Tech**  
  - Paternalistic attitudes limit participation
  - Underrepresentation in tech leadership roles  

- **Awareness**  
  - Many accessibility features remain underutilized due to lack of awareness
  - Lack of training programs for assistive technologies  

### 6.3 Iceberg Model of Digital Exclusion

To better visualize the layered and often hidden barriers facing self-employed
people with disabilities in digital spaces, we developed an
**Iceberg Model of Digital Exclusion**.

This model highlights how visible challenges (e.g., inaccessible apps or lack
of captioning) are just the tip—beneath the surface lie deeper structural,
cultural, and institutional forces that shape digital exclusion.

---

## 8. Conceptual Anchors

- **Disability Justice**: Centers intersectional inclusion, recognizing the diverse
experiences of disabled people, including marginalized identities.
- **Intersectionality**: Highlights how disability intersects with gender, race,
geography (e.g., rural users), and socio-economic status.
- **Techno-Solutionism Critique**: Cautions against one-size-fits-all tech fixes
without involving disabled users in design.
- **Rights vs. Charity**:  Emphasizes disability as a human rights issue rather
than a matter of charity or pity.

---

## 9. Justification for  Research  

**What’s Missing**: Comprehensive data on how digital ecosystems concretely support
disabled entrepreneurs; real-world usability studies; intersectional analysis.

**Why Now**: As digital platforms become central to entrepreneurship, exclusion
risks deepening without targeted inclusion efforts.

**Research Value**: This research aims to fill gaps by providing evidence-based
insights for policymakers, designers, and corporate leaders to promote genuine
inclusion and equity.

## 11. Conclusion  

Digital tech companies support disabled entrepreneurs through accessible tools,
targeted programs, inclusive marketplaces, and mentorship initiatives, enabling
many to overcome traditional barriers.

However, persistent exclusion arises from inadequate accessibility, underrepresentation,
economic constraints, lack of awareness, reactive inclusion practices, and social
biases.

Addressing these challenges requires systemic change, including proactive design,
investment in disability-led innovation, inclusive hiring, and broader cultural
shifts toward disability justice.
