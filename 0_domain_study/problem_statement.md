# Problem Statement

Despite the growing importance of digital technology in driving economic
inclusion, persistent barriers continue to prevent the 1 in 6 people living
with significant disabilities from fully leveraging these tools to pursue
self-employment, achieve self-reliance, and participate meaningfully
in the economy.

Self-employment offers a vital pathway for persons with disabilities (PWDs)
to bypass traditional labor market barriers. Yet digital ecosystems often
treat accessibility as an afterthoughtâ€”resulting in systemic exclusion rather
than proactive inclusion.

This isnâ€™t just a design flaw â€” itâ€™s a missed market. Millions of
potential self-employed individuals with disabilities are being left out.

This project explores how digital and AI technologies shape access,
opportunity, and exclusion for self-employed people with disabilities
in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Our aim is not only to identify barriers, but also to inform more inclusive
design, highlight overlooked opportunities, and support innovation that
reflects the needs and potential of people with disabilities pursuing self-employment.

This research question was shaped by personal experiences, early case studies,
and recurring challenges surfaced during our literature review.

## Actionable Research Question

**How do digital technologies exclude self-employed people with disabilities in
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)?**

## Why This Research Matters

This isnâ€™t just a question of accessibilityâ€”itâ€™s about who gets to build
a livelihood in a digital world.

Millions of self-employed people with disabilities are being left outâ€”not
because of a lack of talent or drive, but because the tools they need
werenâ€™t designed with them in mind.

As more of life moves online, inclusion canâ€™t be an afterthought.
It has to be built in from the start.

ðŸ“ˆ Inclusive design is smart design:

* Unlocks underserved markets
* Makes AI systems fairer and more representative
* Builds digital tools that scale with integrity

## Driving Systemic Change

This research offers tech companies, policymakers, advocates, and
other stakeholders a chance to:

* Redesign tools to better support self-employed people with disabilities
  using inclusive digital and mobile-first solutions.
* Unlock underserved markets by understanding a resourceful and resilient user base.
* Incorporate more diverse, real-world data in digital product development and models.
* Advance ESG goals through authentic inclusion practices
* Highlight regulatory gaps and policy opportunities to foster a more
  inclusive digital ecosystem.
* Provide data and compelling narratives to strengthen advocacy efforts for
  digital rights and equitable access for persons with disabilities.
* Equip organizations with actionable insights to influence corporate social
  responsibility and drive inclusive design practices.
* Contribute to achieving broader socio-economic development goals related to
  disability inclusion and equitable digital participation in SSA.
