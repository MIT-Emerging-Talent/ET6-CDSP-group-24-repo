# Final Presentation

## How We Structured Our Presentation

### Problem Statement

- Opened with a human-centered hook showing the disconnect between digital
 systems and economic realities  
- Used concrete regional statistics (assistive tech costs, data limits) to
 establish urgency  
- Explicitly tied the problem to survival needs of disabled entrepreneurs  

### Challenges & Pivots

- Highlighted the critical pivot from *structured data scarcity* to *qualitative
  analysis*  
- Showcased how scope constraints forced focus on entrepreneurs (vs. all
 disabled persons)  
- Addressed accessibility barriers as both research challenge *and* core finding

### Final Research Question

- Positioned as the evolved outcome of iterative problem refinement  
- Framed as the anchor connecting all subsequent analysis  

### Research Results

- Translated technical findings into 4 barrier categories (Cost, Design, Policy,
  Stigma)  
- Included intersectional critique (gender disparities)  
- Acknowledged limitations implicitly through focus on "lived accounts" vs.
 quantitative data  

### Communication Strategy (60% of time)

- **Solution Focus**: Transitioned from problem â†’ action via the Offline by
 Design platform  
- **Stakeholder Targeting**: Delivered tailored recommendations for 2 key
  audiences (NGOs/Funders)  
- **Impact Metrics**: Proposed concrete success measures (e.g., "Can they use
 this device for business?")  
- **Accessibility**: Used static screenshots (not live demos) + QR code for
 artifact access  
- **Universal Design Principle**: Closed with "design for margins benefits all"
  as core philosophy
