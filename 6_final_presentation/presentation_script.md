# Crystal Pearl Presentation

## Slide 1 — Offline by Design

**Script:**  
“Hello everyone, I’ll be presenting *Offline by Design*, our study on digital exclusion.”

---

## Slide 2 — Sub-Saharan Africa

**Key Points on Slide:**  

- Assistive tech: $1,000+  
- Internet data use: < 100 MB/month  
- Digital access is out of reach for most people with disabilities.

**Script:**  
“Digital systems are fast becoming the default for banking, commerce, and
communication. But in Sub-Saharan Africa, technology can cost over a thousand
dollars, while most people can only afford about 100 megabytes of internet data
 a month. For people with disabilities, that makes digital access nearly
 impossible. That’s where our journey began.”

## Slide 3 — Why Disabled Entrepreneurs?

**Key Points on Slide (Simplified Bullets):**  

- Survival, not choice  
- Digital systems fail them  
- Structured data scarce → unstructured accounts → contextual analysis

**Script:**  
“We narrowed our study to disabled entrepreneurs—because for many,
entrepreneurship is survival. Yet they face significant challenges. Since
structured data on this population was scarce, we turned to reports and lived
accounts to grasp realities we do not directly experience.”

## Slide 4 — How Digital Technology Excludes in SSA

**Slide Layout (Flow):**

- **Box 1 (Tech)**: Mobile | Banking | E-commerce | Internet | Assistive devices
- ⬇  
- **Box 2 (Barriers)**: Cost & Connectivity, Stigma & Representation gaps,
 Design & Skills gaps, Policy gaps  
- ⬇  
- **Box 3 (Impact)**: Exclusion

**Script:**  
“We found layered barriers—from unaffordable tools to apps that ignore
accessibility, to policies that bypass disabled entrepreneurs. The biggest
hurdles were poor connectivity and limited device access. And for women with
disabilities, things were even harder due to added stigma.”

## Slide 5 — Website Screenshot & Recommendations

**Script:**  
“We didn’t just want to describe the problem. We wanted to be part of the
solution. That’s why we built *Offline by Design*—an accessible website for
champions of social good. And here’s what we recommend:

1. **For NGO program officers**: Embed digital access in every program—provide
 devices, data, and digital skills; prioritize the most disconnected groups;
 measure true usability, not just distribution.
2. **For philanthropic funders and advocates**: Invest in what works, like
 disability-led grassroots groups; push for policy enforcement; help fill data
 gaps with locally collected, shared resources.”

## Slide 6 — Design for the Margins

⬇
Better systems for all

**Script:**  
“Finally… back to you, our audience. If digital access is now a basic need, then
 exclusion is not an accident—it’s a choice. Accessibility isn’t only about
 disability rights. A banking app that works with screen readers also helps
 older users. When we design for the margins, we build better systems for
 everyone. That’s the heart of our project—and the call to action we leave you
 with today. Thanks for listening!”
