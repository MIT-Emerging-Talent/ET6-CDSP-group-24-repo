# Manual Coding Memos & Thematic Insights

This document summarizes key insights and patterns that emerged from our manual coding of qualitative data on digital exclusion of persons with disabilities (PWDs). It also includes thematic relationships across categories, based on co-occurrence patterns in the data.

---

## 1. Access Barriers

This theme was the most prevalent across the dataset, reflecting its centrality and the widespread, multi-layered nature of exclusion that persons with disabilities (PWDs) face in digital access.

- **Connectivity**  
  This was the most recurring access barriers subcode. In rural or underserved regions, network and electricity infrastructure remain unreliable. These are not merely technical issues but systemic failures to treat digital participation as a right. Analysis uncovered a usage–coverage paradox: infrastructure may technically exist, but remains inaccessible in practice due to economic, educational, or gender-based constraints.

  Insight: Coverage does not equal access. The real challenge is conversion — getting marginalized users online and sustained.

  **Affordability**  
  Affordability consistently emerged as a structural access barrier, particularly regarding smartphone ownership and mobile internet access.

  - Device ownership: Smartphones remain out of reach due to high costs.
  - Assistive technology (AT): Tools like screen readers were mentioned to cost over $1,000.
  - Training and data: Even where training was available, cost was prohibitive (e.g., $2–3/hr lessons).
  
  Lower income levels and financial dependence compounded the inability to purchase or sustain digital tools. Without economic accessibility, even the best-designed inclusive technologies remain out of reach. Affordability was repeatedly linked with financial dependence, unemployment, and low income — particularly affecting women and rural PWDs

  Insight: Affordability is about economic positioning. Subsidies alone may be insufficient without broader inclusion in livelihood systems.

- **Device Access**  
  Telecom operators often fail to stock or promote accessible devices. This is a dual issue of supply (lack of availability) and demand (lack of awareness or affordability), rooted in procurement practices and market exclusions. Service availability of both tools and support remains minimal and uncoordinated.

  Insight: Access is constrained not only by infrastructure but also by supply chain decisions, retail practices, and lack of awareness.

- **Information Gap**  
  PWDs are often unaware of accessible tools and services, even after visiing multiple institutions, due to poor outreach and education. Outreach efforts by both government and OPDs (organizations of persons with disabilities) seem patchy or absent. There's significant late exposure, where people only encounter digital tools after formal education, making them harder to adopt. This knowledge barrier impedes informed demand.

  Insight: Adoption failure is often an outreach failure. Awareness is a precondition to demand.

- **Gender Gaps & Intersectionality**  
  Women with disabilities are doubly marginalized, excluded by both gender norms and disability. They were consistently less likely to own phones, access the internet, or use assistive tools.Intersectional exclusions further compund exclusion for rural women who face stigma, lack of training, and economic marginalization.

  Insight: Gender fundamentally shapes the form and intensity of digital exclusion.

- **Language & Physical Inaccessibility**  
  Local language gaps and inaccessible physical environments (e.g., retail locations) can prevent digital uptake, especially among users with multiple marginalities.

## 2. Digital Skills Gap

A lack of foundational digital literacy creates persistent barriers to digital inclusion for persons with disabilities (PWDs). This theme often co-occurred with Access Barriers, showing that even where infrastructure or devices are available, PWDs may still be excluded due to low tech readiness or a lack of support ecosystems.

- **Training Needs**  
  Where training programs do exist, they are often unaffordable or not adapted to disabled learners. Built environments, classrooms, and training centers were physically inaccessible, leading to long-term exclusion from learning opportunities. Many telecom staff, not just end-users, lacked training on accessible services, weakening the delivery chain.

   Insight: Skills gaps are not individual failings; they’re systemic exclusions rooted in the design of educational and training infrastructures.

- **Digital Literacy**  
  Educational exclusion from an early age creates generational barriers to tech use. PWDs often do not receive the same digital exposure and instruction as their peers. Some mention low awareness of mobile internet entirely, suggesting gaps in not just skills but exposure and orientation. Even among those with access, data shows very low usage levels (e.g., <100MB/month), suggesting underutilization due to low digital literacy.

  Insight: Adoption rates reflect confidence, comprehension, and relevance.

## 3. Digital Technology & Design

This theme uncovers how tech itself either enables or excludes based on its design. Across the dataset, the most prominent pattern is the prevalence of interface barriers and non-inclusive tools that limit usability, even for platforms claiming accessibility. While some positive examples of inclusive technology exist, they are the exception, not the norm.

- **Interface Barriers**  
  One of the most cited subcodes. Devices and apps are often not built with disability in mind, e.g., no screen reader support, visual-only interaction. Platform usability issues like unlabeled icons, poor contrast, non-compliant form fields, and incompatibility with screen readers were the most frequently cited obstacles. Recurrent challenges occurred during sign-up, product upload, and log-out processes—key tasks necessary for digital entrepreneurship or engagement. Many commonly used e-commerce platforms (e.g., Jumia, Jiji) lacked basic accessibility accommodations, resulting in users abandoning tasks altogether.

  Insight: Exclusion often occurs at the micro-level of design. These interface issues may seem small but result in functional exclusion from essential digital interactions.

- **Inclusive Tech Tools**  
  Positive mentions of universal design — like screen readers, captions, voice commands — show potential, but also reflect their scarcity in practice. Tools like JAWS, Be My Eyes, Seeing AI, and Google Relate demonstrate what is possible when inclusive design is prioritized. Telecom firms like Vodacom and Safaricom introduced assistive apps and services, like IVR, HearZA, or accessible messaging platforms.

  Insight: These tools prove inclusion is possible, but their availability is limited, and awareness among users is low. Inclusion is treated as optional, not standard.

- **AI Bias / Algorithmic Exclusion**  
  A rising issue. Automated systems (recommendations, credit scoring, job filters) may systematically exclude PWDs without human review.This form of exclusion is less visible, but deeply structural, affecting tools that rely on machine learning or automated decision-making.
  
  Insight: AI design must be interrogated through a disability inclusion lens. Bias is not only human, it’s machine-learned.

## 4. Inclusive Digital Ecosystem

This theme reflects ecosystem-level enablers and gaps — policies, market incentives, and institutional frameworks.  It underscores that inclusion isn't just about fixing access problems, but about building ecosystems that embed accessibility, participation, and equity from the ground up.

- **Policy Environment**  
  Many countries have progressive regulations (e.g., UNCRPD), but weak enforcement renders them ineffective. Strong policies on paper are not translating into action. References spanned CRPD (Article 27), SDGs, national charters, and regulations like NCC (Nigeria) or ICASA (South Africa). Policy is positioned not just as legal backing, but as a mechanism for resource allocation, design standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1), and accountability.

  Insight: Policies create norms and incentives, but only function when enforced and tied to infrastructure, markets, and community engagement.

- **Private Sector Role**  
  Telecoms and tech firms can be key change agents. Companies like Safaricom and Vodacom have adopted inclusive practices, while others like MTN and Airtel have lagged.Startups and social enterprises, like the consultancy co-founded by Sibomana, are pioneering AT solutions, mentorship, and employment pipelines. International tech giants (e.g., Microsoft’s AI for Accessibility) fund innovation with a global footprint but often partner locally.

  Insight: Inclusion advances fastest when private actors see it as business strategy. Local entrepreneurship and corporate leadership are two sides of the same systemic coin.

## 5. Social & Systemic Exclusion

This theme centers on institutional, cultural, and representational barriers.  While access and skills gaps are the more visible barriers, social and systemic exclusion reflects the deep-rooted structural forces—like stigma, poor policy enforcement, data invisibility, and underrepresentation—that render persons with disabilities (PWDs) persistently marginalized in the digital economy.

- **Policy Gap**
  Over a dozen references indicate the existence of policies that are either not implemented, poorly enforced, or overly general. Quotes suggest that countries like Rwanda have strong accessibility laws on paper, yet very low digital access outcomes. Telecom operators and companies (e.g., MTN, Airtel) were mentioned as failing to meet procurement or accessibility obligations.

  Insight: Having a policy ≠ meaningful change.

- **Representation Gap**  
  PWDs are rarely included in decision-making, leading to services and policies that do not reflect their realities. Telecom and tech firms were also cited for lacking inclusive products or policies tailored to PWDs.

  Insight: Exclusion is also economic and institutional. Without representation in design, leadership, and capital, exclusion will be built in by default.

- **Data Invisibility**  
  PWDs are statistically invisible in most datasets. Many studies lacked disability-disaggregated data or fell below statistical thresholds due to low digital engagement. Poor fieldwork design (e.g., no sign language interpreters, untrained enumerators) further distorts the data picture. This invisibility hampers program design, limits trend comparisons, and undermines AI fairness.

  Insight: Data neglect creates a vicious cycle: those most excluded are least measured and thus least served.

- **Stigma and Discrimination**  
  Cultural norms and harmful assumptions prevent many PWDs from engaging with tech or accessing services. Even when controlling for socio-economic status, disability still emerged as a "significant determining factor" in mobile access and internet use—suggesting the presence of deep-seated social norms.

  Insight: Inclusion requires confronting social biases

## 6. Resilience & Coping Strategies

This theme captures the everyday ingenuity, social capital, and adaptive practices that people with disabilities employ to navigate exclusion, reclaim agency, and empower others. Unlike systemic-level changes captured in other themes, this one foregrounds the grassroots, peer-driven, and person-centered responses that sustain momentum in the face of persistent structural gaps.

- **Peer Networks**  
  Community-led groups and DPOs serve as critical intermediaries for access, training, and advocacy. Peer support involved hands-on training, exposure to opportunities, mentoship and career preparation.

  Insight: In the absence of formal systems, peer-driven ecosystems step in.

- **Local Solutions**  
  Inclusive adaptations, workarounds, and grassroots innovations often emerge at the local level, especially in low-resource settings.

  Insight: Grassroots leadership organizes, institutionalizes, and scales.

## Major Thematic Relationships

### Access Barriers + Digital Skills Gap

Exclusion is not just about availability of devices or services, it's about knowing how to use them. Without digital literacy, infrastructure alone won’t ensure access.

### Access Barriers + Social & Systemic Exclusion

What seems like an individual limitation (e.g., not owning a phone) often reflects deeper systemic inequality, stigma, and institutional failures.

### Access Barriers + Digital Technology & Design

When tools are poorly designed, they themselves become access barriers. Inclusive design can lower multiple entry barriers at once, it is a gateway to digital rights.
