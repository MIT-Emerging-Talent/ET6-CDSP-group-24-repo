# Manual Coding Memos & Thematic Insights

This document summarizes key insights and patterns that emerged from our manual coding of qualitative data on digital exclusion of persons with disabilities (PWDs). It also includes thematic relationships across categories, based on co-occurrence patterns in the data.

---

## ðŸŸª 1. Access Barriers

This theme was the most prevalent across the dataset, revealing the widespread and multi-layered nature of exclusion that persons with disabilities (PWDs) face in digital access.

- **Affordability**  
  Affordability consistently emerged as a structural access barrier, particularly regarding smartphone ownership and mobile internet access. Lower income levels and financial dependence compounded the inability to purchase or sustain digital tools. Without economic accessibility, even the best-designed inclusive technologies remain out of reach.

- **Connectivity**  
  In rural or underserved regions, network and electricity infrastructure remain unreliable. These are not merely technical issues but systemic failures to treat digital participation as a right.

- **Device Access**  
  Telecom operators often fail to stock or promote accessible devices. This is a dual issue of supply (lack of availability) and demand (lack of awareness or affordability), rooted in procurement practices and market exclusions.

- **Digital Divide**  
  The digital divide intersects with disability, geography, education, and income, compounding exclusion through layered disadvantages.

- **Information Gap**  
  PWDs are often unaware of accessible tools and services due to poor outreach and education. This knowledge barrier impedes informed demand.

- **Gender Gaps & Intersectionality**  
  Women with disabilities are doubly marginalized, excluded by both gender norms and disability. Intersectional exclusions further affect those in rural areas or with multiple disadvantages.

- **Language & Physical Inaccessibility**  
  Local language gaps and inaccessible physical environments (e.g., retail locations) can prevent digital uptake, especially among users with multiple marginalities.

## ðŸŸ¨ 2. Digital Skills Gap

This theme highlights the absence of foundational digital literacy and tech-adaptive skillsets.

- **Training Needs**  
  Many telecom staff, not just end-users, lacked training on accessible services, weakening the delivery chain.

- **Digital Literacy**  
  Educational exclusion from an early age creates generational barriers to tech use. PWDs often do not receive the same digital exposure and instruction as their peers.

## ðŸŸ¦ 3. Digital Technology & Design

This theme uncovers how tech itself either enables or excludes based on its design.

- **Interface Barriers**  
  One of the most cited subcodes. Devices and apps are often not built with disability in mind, e.g., no screen reader support, visual-only interaction.

- **Non-Inclusive Tools**  
  Even when tech is available, it may not serve diverse users, poor contrast, inaccessible interfaces, or fixed configurations that donâ€™t support assistive devices.

- **Inclusive Tech Tools**  
  Positive mentions of universal design â€” like screen readers, captions, voice commands â€” show potential, but also reflect their scarcity in practice.

- **AI Bias / Algorithmic Exclusion**  
  A rising issue. Automated systems (recommendations, credit scoring, job filters) may systematically exclude PWDs without human review.

---

## ðŸŸ§ 4. Inclusive Digital Ecosystem

This theme reflects ecosystem-level enablers and gaps â€” policies, market incentives, and institutional frameworks.

- **Policy Environment**  
  Many countries have progressive regulations (e.g., UNCRPD), but weak enforcement renders them ineffective. Strong policies on paper are not translating into action.

- **Private Sector Role**  
  Telecoms and tech firms can be key change agents. Companies like Safaricom and Vodacom have adopted inclusive practices, while others like MTN and Airtel have lagged.

---

## ðŸŸ¥ 5. Social & Systemic Exclusion

This theme centers on institutional, cultural, and representational barriers.

- **Representation Gap**  
  PWDs are rarely included in decision-making, leading to services and policies that do not reflect their realities.

- **Data Invisibility**  
  A lack of disaggregated disability data leads to poor planning, minimal oversight, and erased needs.

- **Stigma**  
  Cultural norms and harmful assumptions prevent many PWDs from engaging with tech or accessing services.

- **Service Availability**  
  In many contexts, services for PWDs simply do not exist â€” e.g., accessible apps, inclusive data bundles, trained staff.

---

## ðŸŸª 6. Resilience & Coping Strategies

Despite exclusion, PWDs and their communities develop innovative ways to adapt.

- **Peer Networks**  
  Community-led groups and DPOs serve as critical intermediaries for access, training, and advocacy.

- **Local Solutions**  
  Inclusive adaptations, workarounds, and grassroots innovations often emerge at the local level, especially in low-resource settings.

- **Platform Economy**  
  Although rarely mentioned, digital work platforms represent an emerging avenue for inclusion, or new forms of exclusion.

## ðŸ”„ Thematic Relationships

### Access Barriers + Digital Skills Gap

Exclusion is not just about availability of devices or services, it's about knowing how to use them. Without digital literacy, infrastructure alone wonâ€™t ensure access.

### Digital Technology & Design + Inclusive Digital Ecosystem

A strong ecosystem should support inclusive design, but even when policy exists, poor tool design can negate its impact. Conversely, good design can set new ecosystem standards.

### Social & Systemic Exclusion + Data Invisibility

Lack of disability-disaggregated data makes exclusion invisible and persistent. Ethical, participatory data collection is foundational to representation and change.

### Access Barriers + Social & Systemic Exclusion

What seems like an individual limitation (e.g., not owning a phone) often reflects deeper systemic inequality, stigma, and institutional failures.

### Digital Technology & Design + Access Barriers

When tools are poorly designed, they themselves become access barriers. Inclusive design can lower multiple entry barriers at once, it is a gateway to digital rights.
