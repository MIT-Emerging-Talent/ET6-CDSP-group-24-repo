    "1. **Load and extract text** from PDF files grouped by theme.\n",
    "2. **Preprocess** text by removing non-ASCII characters to ensure clean NLP tokenization.\n",

    "4. **Perform KWIC analysis** using spaCy to extract left and right context around each keyword.\n",
    "5. **Display results** in a structured table showing:\n",
