# Findings

## 1. Digital Divide Persists as a Foundational Barrier

### Affordability

**Finding:**
Affordability was a dominant barrier, cutting across device
ownership (e.g., smartphones), assistive technology (e.g., screen readers
costing over \$1,000), and digital training (e.g., \$2–3/hour).
This was especially pronounced among rural, female, and unemployed populations.

**Implication:**
It reflects systemic economic exclusion. The inability to afford tools isn’t a
one-time hurdle, but a persistent condition that keeps PWDs disconnected
long-term, even when “low-cost” options are available.

---

### Connectivity: The Coverage–Usage Paradox

**Finding:**
Connectvity was the most dominant barrier to access. Only 28.5% of SSA is
connected, and despite increasing mobile coverage, barriers
such as expensive data and low digital uptake persist. Connectivity issues
intersected with geography and gender.

**Implication:**
This reveals a disconnect between infrastructure availability and practical
usage. Physical access does not guarantee digital inclusion.

---

### Device Access & Service Availability

**Finding:**
Major telecoms failed to stock accessible or affordable devices. Staff often
redirected customers to basic feature phones. Even when tools were available,
users lacked awareness or support.

**Implication:**
Exclusion happens in the everyday infrastructure of access—the shops, staff, and
systems that mediate device acquisition.

---

### Intersectionality

**Finding:**
Women with disabilities were significantly less likely to own mobile phones,
access the internet, or use assistive technologies. These barriers were
especially severe among rural women, who also faced stigma, limited digital
training opportunities, and entrenched economic marginalization.

**Implication:**
When disability intersects with gender, geography, and poverty, the effects
are multiplicative. These layered vulnerabilities shape both the likelihood of
exclusion and the depth of its consequences.

---

## 2. Skills Gaps Create “Access Illusions”

### Digital Literacy

**Finding:**
Many PWDs lack even basic digital skills. Even telecom/service staff are often
unaware of assistive tech.

**Implication:**
Access exists only in theory. When users and facilitators alike lack digital
fluency, the presence of infrastructure or devices does not translate into meaningful
inclusion. Digital inclusion requires a whole-system literacy approach.

---

### Training Needs

**Finding:**
Skill deficits stem from early educational exclusion, inaccessible learning
spaces, and lack of adapted training programs. Where training exists, it's often
unaffordable or inappropriate for disabled learners.

**Implication:**
Lack of access is mistakenly framed as individual failure. The illusion arises
when the system is inaccessible from the start, but responsibility is shifted to
the individual.

---

### Mobile Internet Readiness

**Finding:**
Even among PWDs with devices, usage is extremely low (e.g., <100MB/month). Many are
unaware of mobile internet or don’t use it meaningfully.

**Implication:**
Presence of mobile access ≠ readiness to use it. Adoption metrics must be paired
with comprehension and confidence  to reflect true inclusion.

---

### Intersectionality

**Finding:**
Women and rural PWDs face deeper skill deficits due to compounding factors like
poverty and gendered exclusion.

**Implication:**
 Skills gaps are not evenly distributed. Some groups appear connected on paper but
 are more profoundly excluded in practice.
 Access illusions are especially dangerous at the margins, they conceal the extent
 of exclusion by averaging over inequity.

---

## 3. Inclusive Design Remains Exceptional Despite Demonstrated Potential

### Interface Barriers

**Finding:**
 Usability issues—such as unlabeled icons, poor contrast, non-compliant form fields,
 and incompatibility with screen readers—were the most frequently cited obstacles.
 These problems consistently occurred at critical interaction points like sign-up,
 product upload, and log-out processes, hindering digital entrepreneurship and
 day-to-day engagement.

**Implication:**
Exclusion often happens at the micro-level of interaction.  When basic interface
elements are not accessible, entire populations are functionally locked out of
digital systems, even when these systems claim to be “inclusive.” Micro-level
design flaws cause macro-level exclusion.

---

### Inclusive Tools

**Finding:**
Technologies like JAWS, Seeing AI, Google Relate, and HearZA show the power of
inclusive tools.

**Implication:**
Inclusive tools remain siloed or inaccessible to most users.  Scattered accessibility
efforts cannot substitute for systemic inclusive design.

---

### AI Bias and Exclusionary Defaults

**Finding:**
Bias in AI systems (e.g., lack of African language support, inaccessible
datasets) emerged as a subtler, but no less critical, concern, contributing to
algorithmic exclusion.

**Implication:**
When AI systems and platforms are not trained or designed inclusively, they
replicate and scale exclusion. The absence of compliance with accessibility
standards means exclusion is baked into the system by default.

---

## 4. Policy Exists, But Implementation Is Weak and Uneven

### Policy-Practice Gap

**Finding:**
Several references across national reports, policy briefs, and interviews point
to a pattern of “checkbox compliance” where digital inclusion policies exist on
paper but fail in implementation. Laws that seem strong (e.g., in Rwanda or
South Africa) yield poor accessibility outcomes in reality.
Telecoms like MTN
and Airtel were cited for not fulfilling legal obligations around procurement or
universal design. This disconnect often leaves self-employed disabled users
navigating broken promises and inaccessible services.

**Implication:**
Without accountability, design standards, or budgetary allocation, government
policies cannot produce structural change.

---

### The Private Sector

**Finding:**
 The private sector—especially large telecoms (e.g., Vodacom,
 MTN, Safaricom)and startups—emerged as a key actor in driving digital inclusion.
 Examples include accessible websites, scholarships, inclusive hiring, SMS/data
 access plans, and disability-specific services. International actors like
 Microsoft (AI for Accessibility) provide funding and global platforms, while
 local entrepreneurs develop adaptive tech and training pipelines.

**Implication:**
While governments falter on enforcement, businesses often lead where they see
strategic or reputational benefit. Corporate action fills gaps but creates patchy
progress due to lack of
coordination or national strategy.

---

## 5. Social Exclusion Reinforces Systemic Barriers

### Data Invisibility

**Finding:**
People with disabilities are statistically invisible in most digital datasets.
Many surveys lacked disability-disaggregated data or fell below sample thresholds
due to low digital uptake. Inadequate field methods, such as absence of sign
language interpreters or poorly trained enumerators, further distort the data landscape.

**Implication:**
Invisibility in data perpetuates invisibility in service. Robust, inclusive
data is foundational  for equitable design, monitoring, and AI fairness.

---

### Representation Gaps

**Finding:**
People with disabilities are rarely in decision-making roles in tech sectors.

**Implication:**
Without representation, exclusion is embedded by default. Inclusive design
requires shifts in who designs, who leads, and who gets funded.

---

### Stigma and Discrimination

**Finding:**
Stigma persists as a silent barrier, especially for women and rural PWDs. Even
after accounting for socioeconomic status, disability remained a statistically
significant factor in phone and internet access. Cultural perceptions, safety
concerns, and assumptions of irrelevance subtly dissuade engagement.

**Implication:**
 Without tackling social exclusion, well-meaning interventions risk low uptake
 or unintended harm. Cultural norms must be addressed for true inclusion.
 Infrastructure alone isn’t enough.

---

### Siloed Collaborations

**Finding:**
Stakeholders often operate in silos, limiting program scale and sustainability.

**Implication:**
 Systemic reform requires deliberate cross-sector coordination, linking
 grassroots efforts, policy mandates, and private sector accountability.
 Otherwise, fragmentation dilutes impact.

---

## 6. Informal Networks Bridge Gaps Left by Formal Networks

### Community & Peer Networks

**Finding:**
Self-employed people with disabilities often rely on informal peer networks for
mentorship, training, emotional support and access
to tools.
These peer strategies often evolve into structured initiatives: local groups,
disability consultancies, or programs like Urumuri Association that offer
training, employment support, and advocacy. Entrepreneurship also emerged as a
recurring pathway for empowerment, combining digital skills, income generation,
and leadership.

**Implication:**
Policymakers must recognize, resource, and partner with grassroots actors as
co-builders of inclusive digital systems. Formal systems should adapt to support,
not replace, this adaptive infrastructure.
