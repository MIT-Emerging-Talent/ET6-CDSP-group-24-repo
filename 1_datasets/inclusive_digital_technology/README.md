- **Source**: inABLE and Technoprise Global
- **Type**: Report  
- **Timeframe**: May 2023  
- **Format**: PDF
- **Connection To Research**: This dataset is directly
aligned with your research question. It shows that disabled self-employers in
Sub-Saharan Africa (in this case, Kenya) are routinely excluded from using
digital and mobile platforms for selling online due to poor accessibility design.
- **Limitations**: Despite rich insights, the report is limited to Kenya,
potentially restricting generalization across Sub-Saharan Africa. It focuses on
e-commerce rather than broader mobile or AI tools like M-PESA or digital credit platforms.

University (Nairobi)
- **Type**: Report  
- **Timeframe**: October 2023
- **Format**: PDF
- **Connection To Research**: This report is highly
relevant to the research question as it maps how AI-powered assistive
technologies are being developed and used across Africa. It highlights
innovations like AI4KSL (a Kenyan sign language recognition tool) , showing how
localized AI tools can potentially support disabled self-employers.
- **Limitations**: The report is mostly descriptive and lacks hard data on how
many disabled people use these technologies or whether they improve
entrepreneurial outcomes. It focuses more on innovation and policy than on
actual digital business activities or mobile platform usage by disabled self-employers.
