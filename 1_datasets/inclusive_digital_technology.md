- **Type**: Report  
- **Timeframe**: May 2023  
- **Format**: PDF
- **Connection To Research**: This dataset is directly
aligned with your research question. It shows that disabled self-employers in
Sub-Saharan Africa (in this case, Kenya) are routinely excluded from using
digital and mobile platforms for selling online due to poor accessibility design.
- **Limitations**: Despite rich insights, the report is limited to Kenya,
potentially restricting generalization across Sub-Saharan Africa. It focuses on
e-commerce rather than broader mobile or AI tools like M-PESA or digital credit platforms.
