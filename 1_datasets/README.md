# üìÇ Dataset Directory

This folder documents the datasets used in our research on **digital and AI exclusion of persons with disabilities (PWDs) in Sub-Saharan Africa**, with a particular focus on self-employed individuals.

## Purpose

  This directory aims to ensure **transparency, reproducibility, and clarity** around our data sources. We worked with a variety of qualitative and unstructured sources, and our goal was to:

- Capture contextual insights not found in structured datasets.
- Support thematic analysis by organizing datasets around recurring domains (e.g., inclusive technology, digital infrastructure, case studies).
- Enable others to trace and understand how our evidence base connects to our central research question.

## Documentation Approach

Each dataset is documented using a structured format that includes:

- A brief **summary description**
- A **collapsible metadata section** with:
  - Source  
  - Type of dataset (e.g., report, article, survey)  
  - Timeframe  
  - File format (e.g., PDF)
  - Connection to research question
  - Noted limitations
- Direct **source link**

> ‚úÖ Note: We refer to each item as a "dataset" even if it's an article, policy report, or survey, as all are treated as **evidence units** in qualitative analysis.

## üìÅ Directory Guide

This folder is divided into sub-files based on **thematic categories**, each in its own `.md` file:

- [barriers_to_access](barriers_to_access.md) ‚Äì Enablers of digital exclusion
- [case_studies](case_studies.md) - Lived experiences of disabled self employed individuals
- [digital_infrastructure](digital_infrastructure.md) ‚Äì Access, connectivity, infrastructure gaps
- [inclusive_digital_technology](inclusive_digital_technology.md) ‚Äì Accessibility features (or flaws), and AI-driven exclusion
- [tech-ecosystem](tech_ecosystem.md) - Actor accountability (design, funding, policy, feedback loops)
- [Irrelevant_datasets](Irrelevant_datasets.md) - are no longer in use, as it is not suitable for our upcoming NLP analysis phase

Each file contains a series of entries in collapsible sections (Dataset 1, Dataset 2, etc.).

## Criteria for Inclusion

We included datasets that:

- Focus on **Sub-Saharan Africa** (regional or country-level)
- Mention **persons with disabilities**, with a focus on **self employers**
- Relate to **digital technologies**, **mobile platforms**, or **AI**
- Offer insights into **barriers, usage patterns, or enablers**

Sources include government reports, NGO briefs, academic publications, media articles, and others.

## üìå Additional Notes

- We included **both high-level reports** and **micro-level stories** to account for systemic patterns and individual experience.
- Some sources may lack granular disability data; limitations are always disclosed in the metadata.
