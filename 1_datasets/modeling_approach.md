## **Building Insights from Stories: Our Data Approach**

*Understanding how technology can inadvertently leave people behind.*

---

### **The Challenge: Beyond Simple Numbers**

Answering our question required more than a few structured spreadsheets. No tidy file captures how voice recognition might *fail* a blind **self-employed individual** in rural Kenya; **exclusion is too nuanced**. Furthermore, this specific intersection ‚Äî **disability, digital tech, and self-employment in Sub-Saharan Africa** ‚Äî is largely underexplored. As a result, comprehensive structured datasets are **scarce**. Given this scarcity and the nuanced nature of exclusion, traditional quantitative approaches were insufficient to capture the depth required. Thus, we chose to model our problem using **qualitative text data**.

---

### **Our Approach: Turning Rich Text into Structured Insights**

We collect **real-world stories** from diverse sources: **NGO reports, news articles, policy documents, blog posts, and corporate announcements**. These texts offer rich human insights into approaches, strategies, and **disabled self-employers'** voices. Our task: transform these unstructured narratives into an **organized dataset**, much like weaving individual threads into a cohesive tapestry.

---

### **How We Structured Our Data**

To analyze these stories, we designed custom "**data tables**" around key research themes. Each entry in our dataset, a "**case**," captures a micro-story illustrating a **point of exclusion, a barrier encountered, or an innovation's failure to be inclusive**.

Here‚Äôs a glimpse of the information we meticulously captured:

| Theme                     | What We Captured                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inclusive Tech Tools** | Platforms (e.g., *M-Pesa, WhatsApp*), accessibility features (or crucial lack thereof), and how AI's design can lead to exclusion.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Tech Ecosystem & Feedback** | Actors (e.g., *MTN, CBM*), their inclusion efforts (or failures in design, hiring, funding, policy), and how **insufficient PWD feedback mechanisms** or ignored feedback leads to exclusion.                                                                                               |
| **Digital Infrastructure** | Gaps in internet/mobile coverage, unreliable power access, and other persistent infrastructure barriers that create exclusion.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Self-Employment Case Studies** | Stories of disabled **self-employed individuals** facing digital barriers, challenges in accessing tools, or instances where digital systems hinder their livelihoods.                                                                                                                            |
| **Barriers to Access** | Specific UX problems, affordability issues, societal stigma manifesting digitally, or policy gaps limiting inclusion and fostering exclusion.            |

For instance, a single row might detail how even initiatives like
**MTN piloting voice banking in Nigeria** could inadvertently **exclude users
without specific device compatibility**; how **CBM's mentoring programs** might
face **barriers in scaling digital access**; or how **Safaricom's
M-Pesa redesign**, despite good intentions, still **leaves gaps for certain
assistive technology users**.

---

### **Why This Approach Works**

We chose this method because key exclusion patterns are often
**non-numerical**. Insights lie in detailed accounts, lived experiences, and
specific shortcomings in innovations. This **qualitative-first approach** allows
us to follow the real signals of change and challenges that quantitative data
alone might miss.

---

### **Understanding Our Data: What It Reveals and Its Limitations**

Our modeling provides rich, real-world examples of **how exclusion manifests
and where digital technologies fall short**. It primarily identifies
**shortcomings, barriers, and patterns of exclusion**. It reveals
**gaps in feedback loops** and highlights stories of **exclusion and the
challenges faced**. It offers a structured lens to compare actors and spot
patterns in accessibility, AI, infrastructure, and policy that lead to exclusion.

However, like any robust research method, it comes with limitations, often due
to the novel nature of our research area and practical constraints:

* **Visibility Bias:** Relies on publicly available reports; might
  underrepresent grassroots efforts or less documented instances of exclusion.
* **Qualitative Ambiguity:** Interpreting narratives can be subjective;
  pinpointing exact causes or comparative "levels" of exclusion is challenging.
* **Lack of Direct User Data:** Most insights are secondhand from reports,
  not direct PwD (People with Disabilities) interviews, potentially missing
  granular experiences of exclusion.
* **No Statistical Generalizability:** Captures specific cases and patterns,
  not broad statistical representation across Sub-Saharan Africa.
* **Inconsistent Depth:** Detail levels vary across sources.
* **Manual Structuring in Underexplored Domains:** Given the largely
  unresearched nature of this specific intersection, the process of manually
  structuring this qualitative data was extensive and resource-intensive.
* **Time and Financial Constraints:** Limited time and funding prevented us
  from conducting more structured data collection methods, such as original
surveys or in-depth interviews. This practical limitation shaped the scope
of our methodology.

### **The Value: A Navigational Map**

Our dataset serves as a **detailed map**, not a perfect mirror. It
helps pinpoint **where digital and AI technologies create barriers and crucial gaps** for disabled **self-employers** in SSA. This framework lays the groundwork for future research, policy development, and **interventions aimed at mitigating exclusion and fostering truly inclusive tech innovation**, truly embodying the *‚ÄòRising‚Äô spirit* of our team‚Äôs objectives.
