<details>  
<summary>View metadata</summary>  

- **Source**: Konza Technopolis Development Authority
- **Type**: Strategic Plan
- **Timeframe**: April 2025
- **Format**: PDF
- **Connection To Research**: Outlines Kenya’s ambitious
vision for a smart city driven by digital and AI technologies but offers little
direct attention to the needs of disabled self-employers
- **Limitations**: Accessibility considerations are absent from its digital
training and infrastructure rollout, and references to disability are generic
and unaccompanied by actionable frameworks or funding. As a result, the plan
risks reinforcing exclusion rather than closing existing gaps for disabled
self-employers in the digital economy.
