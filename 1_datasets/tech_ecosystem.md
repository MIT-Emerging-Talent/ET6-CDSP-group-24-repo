- **Type**: Strategic Program Report
- **Timeframe**: January–December 2024
- **Format**: PDF
- **Connection To Research**:Highlighting the absence of

disabled self-employers invisible to AI and mobile platform designers.
Demonstrating how data exclusion leads to technological exclusion,
particularly in areas like financial services, e-commerce, and digital skilling initiatives.
- **Limitations**: Focuses more on policy and system-level change, not
specifically on entrepreneurship or self-employment use cases. Limited direct
reference to AI or specific mobile platform case studies

## Dataset 5: Digital Skills Training & Disability Inclusion

**Description**: An article profiling Opeoluwa Akinola, a Nigerian tech leader,
and her initiatives to train people with disabilities in digital skills. It
explores both successes and ongoing challenges in mobilizing accessible
digital/AI learning programmes across African settings
<details>  
<summary>View metadata</summary>  

- **Source**: TechCabal – A leading African tech news outlet
- **Type**: News Article
- **Timeframe**: May 2025
- **Format**: Web Article
- **Connection To Research**:Supports the research
 question by illustrating how digital mobile and AI tools often exclude disabled
self-employers through a lack of foundational access. It shows that without
inclusive digital skills training, people with disabilities are unable to take
advantage of mobile-based or AI-driven opportunities like online
entrepreneurship, digital finance, or e-commerce.
- **Limitations**: There is no detailed exploration of how specific AI
technologies are excluding or could be adapted for disabled self-employers.
the article centers more on training initiatives than on actual entrepreneurial
use of digital tools, so it touches on a key barrier without fully exploring
the business outcomes.

## Dataset 6: Konza Technopolis: Abridged Strategic Plan 2023-2027

**Description**: A strategic roadmap for developing Konza Technopolis as a
sustainable, ICT-driven smart city and innovation hub
<details>  
<summary>View metadata</summary>  

- **Source**: Konza Technopolis Development Authority
- **Type**: Strategic Plan
- **Timeframe**: April 2025
- **Format**: PDF
- **Connection To Research**:Outlines Kenya’s ambitious
vision for a smart city driven by digital and AI technologies but offers little
direct attention to the needs of disabled self-employers
- **Limitations**: Accessibility considerations are absent from its digital
training and infrastructure rollout, and references to disability are generic
and unaccompanied by actionable frameworks or funding. As a result, the plan
risks reinforcing exclusion rather than closing existing gaps for disabled
self-employers in the digital economy.
