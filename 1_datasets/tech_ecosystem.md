<summary>View metadata</summary>  

- **Source**: TechCabal – A leading African tech news outlet
- **Type**: News Article
- **Timeframe**: May 2025
- **Format**: Web Article
- **Connection To Research**: Supports the research
 question by illustrating how digital mobile and AI tools often exclude disabled
self-employers through a lack of foundational access. It shows that without
inclusive digital skills training, people with disabilities are unable to take
advantage of mobile-based or AI-driven opportunities like online
entrepreneurship, digital finance, or e-commerce.
- **Limitations**: There is no detailed exploration of how specific AI
technologies are excluding or could be adapted for disabled self-employers.
the article centers more on training initiatives than on actual entrepreneurial
use of digital tools, so it touches on a key barrier without fully exploring
the business outcomes.
