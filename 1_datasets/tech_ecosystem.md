## Dataset 4: Digital Skills Training & Disability Inclusion

and her initiatives to train people with disabilities in digital skills. It
explores both successes and ongoing challenges in mobilizing accessible
digital/AI learning programmes across African settings

<details>  
<summary>View metadata</summary>  

- **Source**: TechCabal – A leading African tech news outlet
- **Type**: News Article
- **Timeframe**: May 2025
- **Format**: Web Article
- **Connection To Research**: Supports the research
 question by illustrating how digital mobile and AI tools often exclude disabled
self-employers through a lack of foundational access. It shows that without
inclusive digital skills training, people with disabilities are unable to take
advantage of mobile-based or AI-driven opportunities like online
entrepreneurship, digital finance, or e-commerce.
- **Limitations**: There is no detailed exploration of how specific AI
technologies are excluding or could be adapted for disabled self-employers.
the article centers more on training initiatives than on actual entrepreneurial
use of digital tools, so it touches on a key barrier without fully exploring
the business outcomes.

## Dataset 5: Best Practices in the Employment of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities: A Case Study of Uganda

**Decsription**: This qualitative case study explores barriers and enablers to employment for persons with intellectual disabilities in Uganda. Drawing from interviews and focus group discussions with 80 participants—including employers (formal/informal), persons with intellectual disabilities, and caregivers—it examines societal attitudes, systemic gaps, and lived experiences across urban and rural contexts.

<summary>View metadata</summary>  

- **Source**: Uganda Association for the Mentally Handicapped / Inclusion Uganda
- **Type**: Qualitative report / case study
- **Timeframe**: Published December 2022
- **Format**: PDF
- **Conection To Research**: This dataset directly addresses structural, attitudinal, and systemic exclusion dynamics within Uganda’s employment systems—especially as they relate to persons with intellectual disabilities (ID). While not focused on entrepreneurship or digital tools per se, it offers highly relevant contextual and qualitative insight into discrimination and labor market exclusion, uneven implementation of disability rights frameworks, attitudinal and capacity gaps in employers and families and barriers to independent livelihoods
These themes map strongly to the broader digital inclusion/exclusion narrative in underserved SSA contexts. It offers grounding context for why exclusion persists and what support systems are (not) functioning.
- **Limitations**: Not focused on digital tech/tools or entrepreneurship. Case focus is Uganda; broader SSA generalizability limited.Interviews and quotes present, but many findings are thematically summarized. Limited engagement with economic inclusion beyond employment framing
