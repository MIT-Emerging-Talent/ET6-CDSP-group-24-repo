Welcome to **CrystalPearl Rising**!

Like crystals formed under pressure and
pearls created through transformation, We combine the clarity and strength of
crystal with the wisdom and hidden beauty of pearl to tackle real-world problems
through innovative data-driven insights and cross-cultural collaboration.

🌟 *We don't just polish data, we transform raw potential into brilliant insights.*

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository documents our journey through a comprehensive data science
project, from initial problem identification to final presentation. Our work
emphasizes collaborative problem-solving, rigorous analysis, and effective
communication of findings to drive actionable insights.

## 📋 Project Milestones

### Milestone 0: Cross-Cultural Collaboration 🤝🏻

**Status**: Complete ✅

- Established team communication frameworks
- Set up collaborative workflows and tools
- Set up communication channels for team coordination
- Agreed upon and established project constraints
- Defined group norms and working agreements
- Established individual and team learning goals

### Milestone 1: Problem Identification 🔍

**Status**: Complete ✅

### Problem Statement

Despite the growing importance of digital technology in driving economic
inclusion, persistent barriers continue to prevent the 1 in 6 people living with
significant disabilities from fully leveraging these tools to pursue
entrepreneurship, achieve self-reliance, and participate meaningfully in the
economy. While entrepreneurship offers a vital pathway for persons with
disabilities (PWDs) to overcome traditional employment barriers and generate
income, the current digital technology ecosystem often operates with a reactive
approach to accessibility, leading to systemic exclusion rather than proactive inclusion.

This is more than a design flaw—it’s a missed market. There are millions
of would-be entrepreneurs being left out.
This project explores how digital technologies—particularly AI and
mobile tools—affect the ability of entrepreneurs with disabilities
in underserved regions to access and benefit from the digital economy.
Our aim is not only to identify barriers but to inform more inclusive design,
highlight untapped opportunities, and support innovation that reflects the
real needs and potential of disabled entrepreneurs.

### Actionable Research Question

**"How does digital technology—particularly AI and
 mobile tools—currently support or exclude entrepreneurs with disabilities in
underserved regions?"**

---

#### Overview

This research explores whether the ongoing wave of digital innovation—spanning
AI, mobile platforms, and fintech—is truly inclusive of entrepreneurs with
disabilities, particularly in low-connectivity and resource-constrained environments.

While these technologies are often celebrated for democratizing access
and opportunity, many remain **inaccessible by design**, unintentionally
excluding a vast segment of entrepreneurs and innovators.

---

#### Purpose

By examining the lived experiences of disabled entrepreneurs in underserved
regions, this study aims to uncover:

- Where digital inclusion efforts are working  
- Where they fall short  
- What usability, access, and systemic barriers persist  

The findings will surface **actionable insights** to inform more inclusive tech ecosystems.

---

#### Strategic Value for Big Tech

This research offers Big Tech companies a chance to:

- **Redesign products** with inclusive AI and mobile interfaces  
- **Tap into new markets**—overlooked yet high-potential user segments  
- **Improve model performance** with more diverse training data  
- **Align with ESG goals** and global digital equity agendas  

---

#### Why It Matters

This isn’t just about accessibility—it’s about shaping the **next generation of
intelligent, ethical, and scalable platforms** across the world’s
fastest-growing digital economies. Inclusion becomes not just a social good, but
a business imperative.

fairness, and building platforms that scale ethically.*
