# Welcome to Crystal Pearl Rising

Like crystals formed under pressure and pearls as hidden treasures revealed
through care, we see people with disabilities as an undiscovered wealth of
strength, wisdom, and beauty. At Crystal Pearl Rising, we’re committed to
transforming technology to be inclusive and empowering—combining clarity,
resilience, and innovation to ensure no one is left behind.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository documents our journey through a comprehensive data science
project, from initial problem identification to final presentation. Our work
emphasizes collaborative problem-solving, rigorous analysis, and effective
communication of findings to drive actionable insights.

## Research Conclusions

**Digital exclusion for entrepreneurs with disabilities in Sub-Saharan Africa** is driven by intersecting structural, technological, and systemic barriers such as affordability, inaccessible design, and weak policy enforcement.  
Yet local innovation and peer networks show powerful resilience that deserves support—not substitution for reform

## 📋 Project Milestones

### Milestone 0: Cross-Cultural Collaboration

**Status**: Complete ✅

- Established team communication frameworks
- Set up collaborative workflows and tools
- Set up communication channels for team coordination
- Agreed upon and established project constraints
- Defined group norms and working agreements
- Established individual and team learning goals

### Milestone 1: Problem Identification

Status: Complete ✅

### Problem Statement

Despite the growing importance of digital technology in driving economic
inclusion, persistent barriers continue to prevent the 1 in 6 people living
with significant disabilities from fully leveraging these tools to pursue
self-employment, achieve self-reliance, and participate meaningfully in the
economy. While self-employment provides a crucial route for persons with
disabilities (PWDs) to bypass traditional labor market barriers and create
income-generating opportunities, the current digital technology ecosystem often
 adopts a reactive stance on accessibility — resulting in systemic exclusion
 rather than proactive inclusion.

This is more than a design flaw — it’s a missed market. Millions of potential
self-employed individuals with disabilities are being left out.

This project explores how digital and AI technologies impact the ability of
self-employed people with disabilities in Sub-Saharan Africa to access and
benefit from the digital economy.

Our aim is not only to identify barriers but also to inform more inclusive
design, highlight untapped opportunities, and support innovation that truly
reflects the needs and potential of people with disabilities pursuing self-employment.

### Actionable Research Question

**How do digital and AI technologies exclude disabled self-employers  
in Sub-Saharan Africa?**

---

#### Overview

This research explores whether the ongoing wave of digital innovation—spanning
AI, mobile platforms, and fintech—is truly inclusive of self employed people with
disabilities, particularly in SSA(Sub-Saharan Africa).

While these technologies are often celebrated for democratizing access
and opportunity, many remain inaccessible by design, unintentionally
excluding a vast segment of Self employed people with disabilities.

---

#### Purpose

By examining the lived experiences of Self employed people with disabilities in
SSA, this study aims to uncover:

- Where digital inclusion efforts are working?
- Where they fall short?
- What usability, access, and systemic barriers persist?

---

#### Strategic Value for Big Tech

This research offers Big Tech companies a chance to:

- ⁠*Redesign digital tools* to better support self-employed people with
  disabilities through inclusive AI and mobile-first solutions  
- ⁠*Unlock underserved markets* by reaching a resilient and resourceful user
 group often excluded by default design  
- ⁠*Enhance model relevance* by incorporating more diverse, real-world data
  that reflects the experiences of disabled users  
- ⁠*Strengthen ESG impact* by advancing inclusive innovation and contributing
  to global digital equity goals  

---

#### Why It Matters

This isn’t just about accessibility—it’s about shaping the **next generation of
intelligent, ethical, and scalable platforms** across the world’s
fastest-growing digital economies. Inclusion becomes not just a social good, but
a business imperative.

---

> 📈 *Inclusive design is smart design—unlocking new markets, improving AI
fairness, and building platforms that scale ethically.*

---

### Milestone 2: Data Collection

Status: Complete ✅

## Building Insights from Stories: Our Data Approach

Understanding how technology can inadvertently leave people behind.

---

### The Challenge: Beyond Simple Numbers

Answering our question required more than a few structured spreadsheets. No tidy
 file captures how voice recognition might fail a blind entrepreneur in rural
 Kenya; *exclusion is too nuanced. Furthermore, this specific intersection
  —disability, digital tech, and entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa — is
  largely underexplored. As a result, comprehensive structured datasets are
  scarce. Given this scarcity and the nuanced nature of exclusion, traditional
 quantitative approaches were insufficient to capture the depth required. Thus,
 we chose to model our problem using qualitative text data*.

---

### Our Approach: Turning Rich Text into Structured Insights

We collect real-world stories from diverse sources: *NGO reports, news
articles, policy documents, blog posts, and corporate announcements*. These texts
 offer rich human insights into approaches, strategies, and disabled
 entrepreneurs' voices. Our task: transform these unstructured narratives into
  an organized dataset, much like weaving individual threads into a
  cohesive tapestry.

---

### How We Structured Our Data

To analyze these stories, we designed custom "data tables" around key research
themes. Each entry in our dataset, a "case," captures a micro-story illustrating
 a **point of exclusion, a barrier encountered, or an innovation's failure to be
  inclusive**.

Here’s a glimpse of the information we meticulously captured:
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Theme                     | What We Captured                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inclusive Tech Tools | Platforms (e.g., M-Pesa, WhatsApp), accessibility features (or crucial lack thereof), and how AI's design can lead to exclusion.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Tech Ecosystem & Feedback | Actors (e.g., MTN, CBM), their inclusion efforts (or failures in design, hiring, funding, policy), and how insufficient PwD feedback mechanisms or ignored feedback leads to exclusion.                                                                                               |
| Digital Infrastructure | Gaps in internet/mobile coverage, unreliable power access, and other persistent infrastructure barriers that create exclusion.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Entrepreneurship Case Studies | Stories of disabled entrepreneurs facing digital barriers, challenges in accessing tools, or instances where digital systems hinder their livelihoods.                                                                                                                            |
| Barriers to Access | Specific UX problems, affordability issues, societal stigma manifesting digitally, or policy gaps limiting inclusion and fostering exclusion.                                                                                                                                            |

For instance, a single row might detail how even initiatives like *MTN piloting
 voice banking in Nigeria* could inadvertently *exclude users without specific
 device compatibility;
 how CBM's mentoring programs might face barriers in
 scaling digital access; or how**Safaricom's M-Pesa redesign, despite good
 intentions*, still leaves gaps for certain assistive technology users.

---

### Why This Approach Works

We chose this method because key exclusion patterns are often *non-numerical.
 Insights lie in detailed accounts, lived experiences, and specific
 shortcomings in innovations. This qualitative-first approach allows us to
 follow the real signals of change and challenges that quantitative data alone
 might miss.

---

### Understanding Our Data: What It Reveals and Its Limitations

Our modeling provides rich, real-world examples of *how exclusion manifests and
where digital technologies fall short. It primarily identifies **shortcomings,
 barriers, and patterns of exclusion. It reveals
gaps in feedback loops** and highlights stories of exclusion and the **challenges
faced**. It offers a structured lens to compare actors and spot patterns in
accessibility, AI, infrastructure, and policy that lead to exclusion.

However, like any robust research method, it comes with limitations, often due
to the novel nature of our research area and practical constraints:

- Visibility Bias: Relies on publicly available reports; might underrepresent
  grassroots efforts or less documented instances of exclusion.
- ⁠Qualitative Ambiguity: Interpreting narratives can be subjective;
  pinpointing exact causes or comparative "levels" of exclusion is challenging.
- ⁠Lack of Direct User Data: Most insights are secondhand from reports, not
  direct PwD (People with Disabilities) interviews, potentially missing
granular experiences of exclusion.
- ⁠No Statistical Generalizability: Captures specific cases and patterns, not
  broad statistical representation across Sub-Saharan Africa.
- ⁠Inconsistent Depth: Detail levels vary across sources.
- ⁠Manual Structuring in Underexplored Domains: Given the largely
  unresearched nature of this specific intersection, the process of manually
  structuring this qualitative data was extensive and resource-intensive.
- ⁠Time and Financial Constraints: Limited time and funding prevented us from
   conducting more structured data collection methods, such as original surveys
   or in-depth interviews. This practical limitation shaped the scope of our methodology.

### The Value: A Navigational Map

Our dataset helps pinpoint **where digital and AI technologies create barriers and crucial gaps for self employed people with disabilities in SSA**. This framework lays the groundwork for future research, policy development, and *interventions aimed at mitigating exclusion and fostering truly inclusive tech innovation, truly
embodying the*‘Rising’ spirit of our team’s objectives.

### Milestone 3: Data Analysis  

Status: Complete ✅

## Hybrid Analysis Summary

Our research combined manual qualitative analysis and machine-assisted natural language processing (NLP) to explore barriers to digital inclusion for persons with disabilities (PWDs), with an emphasis on understanding how these barriers may impact economic participation.

### Manual Analysis

We conducted a structured manual review of 7 documents using a collaboratively developed codebook centered around themes such as access, design, policy, and systemic exclusion.

Due to limited direct data on PWD entrepreneurs, we relied heavily on **proxy data**—examining recurring patterns of exclusion, accessibility gaps, and institutional neglect. This allowed us to infer likely challenges to PWD participation in digital economies, including entrepreneurship. Our thematic coding approach enabled detailed qualitative insights from a relatively small sample.

### NLP-Assisted Analysis

We applied a suite of natural language processing techniques to complement and scale our manual review:

- **Keyword-in-Context (KWIC)** to analyze how key terms were used in surrounding context
- **BERTopic** to generate embeddings and cluster documents into latent themes using unsupervised learning

This machine-assisted layer aimed at validating and extending our manual findings, especially by revealing patterns not immediately visible through close reading.

Together, the hybrid method provided a more robust understanding of exclusion in the digital ecosystem and its implications for economic inclusion.

## Thematic Insights – Findings

For a full view of our thematic insights, see [`manual_analysis_insights.md`](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-24-repo/blob/main/4_data_analysis/manual_analysis_insights.md)

### 1. Access to digital technology is constrained by overlapping structural barriers

Affordability, device access, and poor connectivity emerged as the most prevalent access issues, particularly in rural or underserved areas. Many PWDs are economically excluded from purchasing smartphones or data plans, while telecom providers often fail to stock accessible devices.

### 2. Skills gaps magnify access gaps

Lack of digital literacy and minimal training opportunities, both for users and telecom staff, were widespread. These gaps limit PWDs' ability to meaningfully engage with available tools or services, creating an *"access illusion."*

### 3. Inclusive design is the exception, not the norm

Poor interface design and non-inclusive tools often made existing technology unusable. However, a few inclusive tech efforts, like screen readers or voice control, showed how design can be a gateway to inclusion if prioritized.

### 4. Policies exist, but enforcement is weak

While many countries have regulations supporting digital inclusion, most were inconsistently applied or unknown to staff. The private sector plays a critical role—some firms like Safaricom and Vodacom have inclusion strategies, while others lag behind.

### 5. Social and systemic exclusion reinforce digital barriers

Stigma, representation gaps, and data invisibility emerged as deeper forces behind exclusion. Without disaggregated data and participatory design, many PWDs remain unseen, and thus underserved.

### 6. PWDs build workarounds, but these shouldn’t replace systemic change

Peer networks and local solutions show strong community resilience, but they often arise from necessity rather than choice. Their existence points to system failure, not success.

## Key patterns

For a full view of our thematic insights, see [data analysis.md](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-24-repo/tree/main/4_data_analysis).

### 1. Digital divides persist as foundational barriers requiring coordinated response

Digital access and connectivity challenges dominate across all analyses, with affordability, device access, and poor connectivity particularly acute in rural areas.
Many PWDs face economic exclusion from purchasing smartphones or data plans, while basic infrastructure gaps continue to limit meaningful participation despite existing technological capacity.

### 2. Skills gaps create "access illusions" that magnify structural barriers

Lack of digital literacy and minimal training opportunities for both users and service providers create situations where theoretical access fails to translate into meaningful engagement.
These gaps limit PWDs' ability to engage with available tools, creating an "access illusion" where technology exists but remains unusable.

### 3. Inclusive design remains exceptional despite demonstrated potential

While assistive technologies like screen readers and voice control show transformative potential, inclusive design principles are inconsistently applied. Poor interface design often makes
existing technology unusable, yet these accessibility solutions remain separate from mainstream technology discussions rather than integrated standards.

### 4. Policy frameworks exist but enforcement mechanisms are weak

National policies supporting digital inclusion are present but inconsistently applied and often unknown to frontline staff. While some private sector firms have developed inclusion strategies,
variable commitment across the sector highlights the critical need for stronger policy enforcement mechanisms.

### 5. Economic barriers demand integration with broader social protection systems

Mobile internet costs and device affordability cannot be addressed through technology solutions alone. The intersection of cost-related challenges with social protection needs suggests digital
inclusion initiatives must be embedded within comprehensive economic support systems rather than treated as standalone interventions.

### 6. Organizational partnerships show promise but operate in silos

Collaborative approaches and PWD-focused programs demonstrate growing recognition of disability needs, but these efforts often remain isolated from mainstream development initiatives.
Case studies show active innovation, but their concentration in specific organizations suggests scaling and systematic adoption remain significant challenges.

### 7. Social exclusion reinforces digital barriers through invisibility and stigma

Stigma, representation gaps, and data invisibility perpetuate exclusion beyond technical constraints. Without disaggregated data and participatory design, many PWDs remain unseen and underserved.
While community solutions show resilience, they often arise from system failure rather than success.

### 8. Youth and financial inclusion represent untapped pathways for systemic change

Digital financial services and youth entrepreneurship initiatives highlight significant opportunities, with employment and skills development emerging as critical leverage points.
However, separation of these opportunities from disability-focused discussions indicates substantial untapped potential for cross-sector collaboration.

---

## Confidence in Results

### Manual Analysis Confidence

We have **high confidence** in the core findings of our manual analysis. Multiple coders reviewed the data and consistently identified recurring patterns such as affordability barrier, policy neglect and digital literacy gaps. These themes appeared across different documents and were frequently supported by direct excerpts.

However, confidence is **moderate to lower** for subthemes with fewer mentions (e.g., physical inaccessibility, AI bias) or where coding required interpretation of ambiguous language. The small sample size (7 documents) and use of proxy data (documents not directly focused on entrepreneurs with disabilities) also limit the generalizability of the results.

### NLP Analysis Confidence

The NLP findings provide **exploratory insights** rather than definitive conclusions. Topic modeling and KWIC helped us identify patterns and validate qualitative themes, but the results depend on:

- The quality of pre-cleaned text inputs
- The interpretability of clustered topics
- Keyword selection for KWIC

Topic labels were manually interpreted, and as with all unsupervised models, there's a risk of overfitting or thematic overlap.

### Overall Confidence

We are confident that our **core conclusions are grounded in evidence** and reflect real, recurring forms of exclusion. However, we acknowledge the **limitations of small datasets, proxy populations**, and the need for future work with more representative and direct participant data.

---

### Limitations

While our hybrid analysis offers both depth and breadth, several limitations should be acknowledged:

1. **Small and Uneven Sample Size**  
   Our dataset consisted of only 11 documents, with varying lengths, formats, and levels of detail. Some documents were rich in qualitative content, while others offered only surface-level insights. This may limit the generalizability of our findings.

2. **Limited Direct Data on PWD Entrepreneurs**  
   Much of our analysis relied on proxy indicators—barriers to access, inclusion, and infrastructure—which we used to infer the likely experiences of entrepreneurs with disabilities. However, the absence of focused data on this specific population introduces an interpretive layer that may not capture the full picture.

3. **Manual Coding Subjectivity**  
   Although we used a shared codebook and cross-validated coding decisions, manual analysis is inherently interpretive. Researcher bias, background, or framing could influence how codes were applied or how themes were interpreted.

4. **NLP Context Limitations**  
   While BERTopic helped scale analysis, these models treat documents as linguistic patterns, not lived experiences. As such, NLP tools may underrepresent contextual nuance, cultural specificity, or implicit meaning, especially in advocacy or policy texts.

5. **Lack of Disaggregated Data**  
   Many documents failed to disaggregate findings by gender, age, or rural-urban divides. This constrained our ability to draw intersectional insights, particularly around issues like compounded exclusion or localized barriers.

6. **Time Constraints**  
   Given the time-sensitive nature of the analysis, we prioritized high-frequency and co-occurring themes. Deeper narrative synthesis or stakeholder validation was not possible within the project timeline.

---

### Ideas for Future Research

- Deep-dive studies on underrepresented groups (e.g., women with disabilities, rural micro-entrepreneurs).

- Longitudinal or case-based analysis to examine how inclusion efforts evolve over time.

- Exploring AI Bias and automation risks in more detail, especially in platform-based or informal digital work.

- Training NLP models on this codebook to scale thematic insights across the full dataset.
