# Building Insights from Stories: Our Data Approach

## Our Research Question

We're investigating a crucial question:  
**How can inclusive digital tools — especially mobile technology and AI —
support people with disabilities in becoming self-employed in Sub-Saharan Africa?**

---

## The Challenge: Beyond Simple Numbers

Answering our question required more than a few structured spreadsheets. No
tidy file
captures how voice recognition aided a blind entrepreneur in rural Kenya —
inclusion is too nuanced.

This specific intersection — **disability, digital tech, and self employed
in SSA(Sub-Saharan Africa)** — is largely underexplored. As a result,
 **comprehensive structured datasets are scarce**.

➡️ **We chose to model our problem using qualitative text data.**

---

## Our Approach: Turning Rich Text into Structured Insights

We collected real-world stories from diverse sources, NGO reports, News articles,
 Policy documents, Blog posts, Corporate announcements.

These texts offer **rich human insights** into strategies, approaches, and the
 lived voices of self employed PwD(People with Disabilities).

Our task?  
**Transform unstructured narratives into organized insight** — weaving
individual threads into a cohesive tapestry.

## How We Structured Our Data

To analyze these stories, we created custom “data tables” built around key
research themes.  
Each dataset entry — a **“case”** — captures a **micro-story** of inclusion,
exclusion, or innovation.

### For example

A single row might describe:

- MTN piloting voice banking in Nigeria  
- CBM mentoring disabled entrepreneurs in Nairobi  
- Safaricom redesigning M-Pesa after testing with blind users

---

## Why This Approach Works

We chose this method because **key exclusion patterns are often
non-numerical**.  
The insights lie in:

- Lived experiences  
- Context-specific innovations  
- Grassroots-level stories  

This **qualitative-first** approach helps us trace **real-world signals of
change** and unmet needs.

## Understanding Our Data: What It Reveals and Its Limitations

Our model provides:

- Concrete examples of innovation & exclusion  
- Feedback loops & design lessons  
- A comparative lens across accessibility, AI, infrastructure & policy  

### But there are limitations

|  Challenge                     | Description |
|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **Visibility Bias**            | Relies on public reports; may miss grassroots initiatives |
| **Qualitative Ambiguity**      | Narrative interpretation is subjective |
| **No Direct User Input**       | Mostly secondhand data — not interviews with PwDs |
| **Not Statistically Generalizable** | Focuses on depth, not statistical breadth |
| **Inconsistent Source Depth**  | Data detail varies |
| **Originality of Research**    | We manually structured under-researched areas |
| **Time & Financial Constraints** | More time or funding could’ve enabled structured surveys |

## The Value: A Navigational Map

Think of our dataset as a **map**, not a mirror.  
It helps identify:

- Digital inclusion pathways  
- Critical gaps in support  
- High-impact design opportunities

This framework lays the groundwork for **future research**,
**policy development**, and **inclusive tech innovation**.

Each row is a real-world story of **inclusion**, **exclusion**, or
 **innovation** in action.
