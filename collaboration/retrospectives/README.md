# 🔄 Retrospectives

This folder contains reflections on each milestone of our CDSP group project.
Retrospectives help us look back on what worked, what didn’t, and what we
learned—individually and as a team.

🔗 [Back to Main README](../../README.md)

## Purpose

Retrospectives are more than a project requirement—they’re our way of
practicing **intentional reflection** and building a culture of **continuous learning**.

* **Improve future work** by identifying what helped and what held us back.
* **Support team alignment** through open conversations about collaboration and process.
* **Document insights** for others to learn from our experience—future teams,
  mentors, or even ourselves.

## 💡 How to Use This Folder

If you're a **teammate, instructor, or future project group** reviewing this repo, our retrospectives offer a candid window into how we worked—not just what we produced. We hope they help you **plan, reflect, and adapt your own workflow**.

Feel free to reuse our template, borrow what worked, and learn from what didn’t.
