# Individual Retrospectives ‚Äì Milestone 5: Final Presentation

This document captures the project‚Äôs personal side: how each member experienced
the sprint toward our final pitch.

While the group retrospective reflects on the milestone as a whole, these
individual reflections highlight what went well, the hurdles faced, and the
lessons learned from each person‚Äôs point of view. They reveal how different
members balanced content, timing, and delivery under pressure ‚Äî and how the
team‚Äôs collective work was shaped by those personal experiences.

Together, they add depth to the story of our final presentation, reminding us
that behind the polished slides and script was a team navigating energy,
creativity, and collaboration right to the end.

## Jola's Reflection

**What went well?**

- We successfully coordinated and executed our tasks, especially finalising the
  presentation script and designing the slides.

**What were the challenges?**

- Our engagement was low compared to previous milestones. It particularly
  seemed like we did not care as much to perfect the results from the last
  deliverable, the landing page for example. We had several reviews but only
  acted on a few corrections. Generally, morale was low.

**What did you learn or discover?**

- I've learned that when communicating with an audience, the way you frame and
  present the story often resonates more than the research methodology itself.
  It's about making the information relatable, engaging, and emotionally
  compelling ‚Äì how you 'sell' the story can be the difference between
  capturing their attention and driving action.

**What‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôll do differently next time?**

- It might be beneficial to check in with the team and do something to boost
  morale and engagement before going into the final stretch. Maybe a
  team-building activity or a quick vibe check to ensure everyone is on the
  same page and motivated to push through to the finish line.

**Any final thoughts on collaboration?**

- We made it through. Well done to us ü§ùüëè

## Karim's Reflection

**What went well?**

- We did a great job identifying how to present our project within the
  2:30-minutes time limit, focusing on both the artifact and the targeted audience.
- Splitting the team into two groups, one for preparing the slide content and
  the other for designing the slides was an excellent strategy. It allowed us
  to work more efficiently and complete the presentation before the deadline.

**What were the challenges?**

- The team‚Äôs overall energy was not as strong as in previous milestones, which
  caused delays in delivering some tasks and resulted in certain parts being
  completed later than planned.

**What did you learn or discover?**

- I learned that presenting a project in such a short timeframe (2:30 minutes)
  can be quite challenging. Deciding what to include and what to leave out
  requires careful planning. It‚Äôs important to highlight the most significant
  aspects of the project while dedicating most of the time to showcasing the
  artifact and explaining its relevance to the targeted audience.

**What‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôll do differently next time?**

- I think having a motivating kickoff meeting at the start of the milestone
  would have helped us maintain the same energy level and finish strong.
- We could have also completed the presentation a few days earlier instead of
right at the deadline. A clearer roadmap and more balanced task assignment
would have contributed to better time management and reduced last-minute pressure.

**Any final thoughts on collaboration?**

- This milestone experience highlighted the importance of good communication,
  balanced workload distribution, and supporting each other when motivation decreases.
- This project showed that our group can adapt to challenges, divide
  responsibilities strategically, and still achieve a strong outcome under time constraints.

## Muqadsa's Reflection

**What went well?**

- The slide design worked beautifully with the script: minimal, accessible,
  and visually clean. It let the story stand out without overwhelming the audience.
- We distilled months of research into a crisp 2.5-minute story that felt coherent
  and impactful.

**What were the challenges?**

- I wasn‚Äôt able to contribute as actively as I would have liked at times due to
  personal commitments. That meant I often joined more in feedback mode rather
  than deep drafting, which sometimes made me feel slightly on the margins of
  the process.
- Energy and time pressure were definitely factors. By this point in the
  project, everyone was tired, and at moments the feedback cycle felt heavier
  than it needed to be.
- It was also a challenge balancing small refinements without them being read
  as ‚Äúbig rewrites‚Äù ‚Äî I had to frame suggestions carefully.

**What did you learn or discover?**

- I learned that in presentations, clarity and confidence matter more than
  covering every detail. A few well-chosen examples or vivid lines can land
  harder than a long list of points.
- I also discovered how much tone and delivery shape perception. Even the
  strongest content can lose impact if it comes across defensive, while a
  confident, story-like delivery makes the same material resonate.
- I also realized how easily fatigue shows up in late stages, and how important
  it is to keep feedback light and focused.

**What‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôll do differently next time?**

- Rehearse delivery earlier ‚Äî not just to check time, but to hear how the story
  lands out loud, since pacing and tone often reveal gaps that text alone hides.
- Be clearer in framing feedback as either polish or structural changes, so the
  team can weigh edits without confusion.

**Any final thoughts on collaboration?**

- Even with energy dipping, I appreciated how we still pulled through and
  delivered something strong.
- The openness to feedback, good design work, and willingness to adapt under
  pressure are what made this team work.
- Most of all, it was satisfying to see all the pieces ‚Äî research, analysis,
and design ‚Äî come together into a final pitch we can be proud of.

## Omnia's Reflection

**What went well?**

- I‚Äôm proud of how our team managed to bring months of research and
  collaboration into a clear, concise story. Despite the short time limit,
  we highlighted both our process and the artifact in a way that felt coherent
  and engaging.
- The flow between presenters worked smoothly, and the simplicity of the slides
  made our message stand out without overwhelming the audience.

**What were the challenges?**

- Balancing detail with brevity was difficult. We had so much valuable work to
  show, but the 2.5-minute limit forced tough choices on what to keep and what
  to leave out.
- Team energy was noticeably lower compared to earlier milestones, which
  made coordination a little harder and sometimes slowed momentum.

**What did you learn or discover?**

- I learned how essential storytelling is when presenting complex findings.
  People connect more with a clear, human-centered narrative than with
  technical detail alone.
- I also discovered that rehearsals and alignment on messaging make a huge
  difference when we were prepared and on the same page, delivery felt
  confident and natural.

**What‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôll do differently next time?**

- I would push for earlier rehearsals with time checks, so we could refine
  delivery without rushing at the last minute.
- I‚Äôd also like us to lock in a strong opening hook earlier in the process
  something that immediately captures attention and sets the tone.

**Any final thoughts on collaboration?**

- Even with the challenges, I truly valued the support and adaptability of
  the group. Everyone showed up, divided responsibilities, and we still
  delivered something meaningful under pressure.
- What stood out most was the encouragement we gave each other when energy
  dipped that sense of teamwork was what kept us going, and it‚Äôs something
  I‚Äôll carry forward to future projects.

## Robel's Reflection

**What went well?**

- Despite tight timelines, our team completed the slide content on time.
  Meeting this key milestone helped maintain momentum and strengthened
  confidence across the project.

**What were the challenges?**

- We had to sharpen and distill a rich body of research into a concise
  2.5-minute presentation,deciding what to include and what to omit to make the
  content feel more complex than ever.

**What did you learn or discover?**

- I discovered the power of tailoring your message‚Äîmaking sure it's clear,
  direct, and resonates with the people you‚Äôre speaking to.
- I learned to distill complex ideas into simple, memorable messages‚Äîfocusing
  on what truly matters, avoiding unnecessary jargon

**What‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôll do differently next time?**

- I‚Äôll hone the art of delivering a sharp, crystal-clear message‚Äîespecially
  when time is tight.
- I aim to weave content into compelling narratives that speak directly to
  non-technical audiences. By simplifying, storytelling, and trimming away
  the noise, I‚Äôll ensure every word counts and resonates clearly.

**Any final thoughts on collaboration?**

- We kept our collaborative spirit alive despite one persistent stumbling
  block: finalizing meeting minutes on time. It reminded us how important
  time management and clarity are for keeping everyone aligned and not
  delaying critical follow-through. According to project management best
  practices, implementing tools like task-tracking boards or time-blocked
  agendas can streamline processes and reduce these delays.
- It‚Äôs bittersweet to wrap up this project. I‚Äôm truly going to miss working
  with this team‚Äîunless we get one more chance to take on ELO2 together,
  in which case I‚Äôd jump at it! The collaboration, energy, and camaraderie
  were real highlights of this journey.
