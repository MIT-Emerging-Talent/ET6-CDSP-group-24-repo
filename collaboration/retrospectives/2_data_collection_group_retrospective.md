# Milestone Retrospective: Data Collection

This milestone was all about diving deep into data and making sense of the raw
material for our project. From meticulously identifying diverse sources to
wrestling with qualitative nuances, this phase truly tested our adaptability
and critical thinking. It established a vital foundation that deepened our
collective understanding of the research landscape.

The intricacies of our collective activities are comprehensively captured
within the team's reflections below, illustrating how we collaboratively
addressed challenges and advanced our learning. Each team member also completed
their own personal reflection for this milestone.
These were based on the shared prompt and offer insight into their unique experiences.

## Key Achievements

- **Adaptive Learning & Strategic Pivot:** We successfully navigated the initial
  uncertainty around data types, collectively realizing the immense value of
  qualitative data for our research question. This pivotal shift showed our
  teamâ€™s flexibility and readiness to rethink our approach when needed.

- **Strong Team Collaboration:** Our team maintained a high level of commitment,
  open communication, and mutual support throughout the milestone. Meeting
  attendance was excellent, ideas were shared freely, and a collaborative
  spirit made complex tasks smoother.

- **Establishing Foundational Workflows:** We established clear workflows for
  data collection and documentation early on, with efforts like creating
  separate documents for each step. This provided essential structure and helped
  keep our collaborative work organized.

- **Developing Practical Data Skills:** As a group, we gained valuable practical
  skills in exploring diverse data sources, identifying credible qualitative
  materials, and understanding how to assess data suitability for our research.

- **Effective Tool Utilization:** We effectively leveraged tools like Slack,
  WhatsApp , and Google Docs, which streamlined our communication, collaborative
  documentation, and brainstorming processes.

## Challenges Faced

Our learning journey often brought challenges that highlighted areas where we
can grow even stronger. These patterns emerged from our collective experiences
and point to specific improvements for future milestones.

- **Initial Data Type Misalignment & Scope Refinement:** We began with an an
  initial focus on quantitative data, which later proved less feasible for our
  nuanced research question. This led to some delays and required a significant
  adjustment in our data collection strategy.

  - *Root Cause:* Limited prior familiarity with qualitative data and
  insufficient upfront discussion on the implications of specific data types
  for our complex research.
- **Meeting Efficiency & Focus:** While our discussions were open, meetings
  often ran longer than planned and sometimes lost focus, particularly when
  tackling abstract concepts.

  - *Root Cause:* Despite having agendas, the depth of topics and the need for
  thorough alignment on complex ideas made it difficult to stay within
  timeboxes and maintain consistent engagement.
- **Aligning on Shared Purpose and Output Priorities:** Even with clear
  workflows, aligning on what the final output should look like â€” and which
  parts mattered most â€” proved harder than expected. We sometimes spent time
  polishing elements before core pieces were finalized.

  - *Root Cause:* Conceptual alignment takes time, especially in new domains.
  Clearer team consensus on `` `must-haves` `` early on would have sharpened
  our focus.
- **Data Organization & Assessment Nuances:** Organizing collected qualitative
  materials thematically proved time-consuming due to varied formats, and
  assessing the credibility of certain open-source materials required extra
  validation steps.

  - *Root Cause:* The inherent unstructured nature of qualitative data and the
  novel domain meant consistent depth and clear vetting criteria were still evolving.

## Lessons Learned

Our experiences during this milestone provided invaluable insights that will
guide our future work.

- **Data-Strategy Alignment is Paramount:** Understanding the true nature of
  the data needed for our research question, and adapting our strategy early,
  is critical to avoid delays and ensure efficiency.

- **Proactive Planning Reduces Bottlenecks:** Defining potential risks,
  limitations, and the next concrete steps after major decisions helps
  streamline the workflow and prevent future roadblocks.

- **Structured Discussions Drive Efficiency:** Clear meeting goals, defined
  schedules, pre-study, and effective note-taking are essential to maximize
  productivity and keep everyone engaged during discussions.

- **Alignment Requires Deliberate Effort:** Achieving a shared vision and
  common understanding of expected outputs takes dedicated time and iterative
  discussion, especially in underexplored areas.

- **Documentation is a Living Tool:** Approaches to documentation need to
  evolve with the data, and consistent, accessible record-keeping helps prevent
  repetition and ensures shared knowledge.

> As Jola aptly reflected, "Saw firsthand how early decisions have ripple
> effects on the rest of the workflow, underscoring the value of proactive
> planning." This collective realization will be a key guide moving forward.

## Action Plan & Next Steps

As we move into the "Data Analysis" milestone, weâ€™re applying these lessons to
make our next phase smoother and more focused, specifically in how we approach
our analysis.

- **Pre-Study Analysis Techniques:** Before diving into analysis, we will
  dedicate time to research and understand new analysis techniques, ensuring
  they are appropriate for our questions and data, and acknowledging their limitations.

- **Define Analytical Outcomes Upfront:** For every analytical task, we will
  explicitly discuss and align on the `` `must-have` `` insights and the
  non-technical findings we aim for, considering what questions our data
  analysis can truly answer.

- **Structured and Time-Boxed Meetings:** We will establish clearer meeting
  schedules and durations, with specific agendas and agreed-upon time
  allocations for each topic.

- **Enhanced Note-Taking & Summaries:** We will improve our collective
  note-taking during discussions and commit to summarizing key decisions and
  expected outputs at the end of meetings in a shared, easily accessible document.

- **Proactive Risk Identification & Uncertainty Assessment:** After major
  analytical decisions, we will proactively discuss potential flaws, sources of
  uncertainty, and explicitly ask "How could I be wrong?" This will help us
  prepare for and communicate undesirable or inconclusive results.

> Thanks to everyone's persistence and collaboration, this data collection
> milestone deepened our understanding and teamwork.
> We've emerged stronger, laying a clear foundation for the analytical phase.
> Let's carry this same energyâ€”now with a sharper analytical lensâ€”into the next milestone.
