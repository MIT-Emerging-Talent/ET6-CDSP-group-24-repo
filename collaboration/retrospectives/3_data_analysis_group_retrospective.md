# Milestone Retrospective: Data Analysis

This milestone focused on making meaning from complexity. From interpreting
patterns in narrative-rich data to scaling insights through NLP, it challenged
us to think critically and collaboratively. It also deepened our shared
understanding of how exclusion shows up across digital systems.

Individual reflections capture how each team member navigated uncertainty,
built new skills, and contributed to our process. These were based on the shared
prompt and offer insight into their unique
experiences.

## Key Achievements

- **Effective Hybrid Analytical Approach**: Our decision to combine manual
  coding with automated (NLP) analysis proved highly successful. This strategy
  provided us with both granular, in-depth detail and a broader understanding of
  the data, significantly enriching our insights.

- **Strong Internal Sub-team Collaboration & Calibration**: Within our manual
  coding sub-team, we established a great rhythm, efficiently navigating
  ambiguities and ensuring consistent interpretation through effective
  calibration sessions. Similarly, the NLP sub-team successfully applied
  various techniques to extract meaning from the data.
  
- **Effective Tool Utilization**: Shared documents and GitHub issues helped
  coordinate asynchronous work.

- **Deepened Research Methods Understanding**: Team members gained valuable
  practical experience and confidence in applying qualitative analytical
  methodologies, including manual thematic coding, and various NLP techniques
  like Topic Modeling, Keyword Extraction, and Keywords in Context (KWIC). We
  also gained a deeper understanding of how NLP directly addresses our research question.

## Challenges Faced

- **Initial Alignment & Planning Delays** An early planning meeting
  unexpectedly shifted its focus, and a mismatch in
  data relevance and expectations came to light. Addressing this required
  significant effort and caused an approximate week-long delay in finalizing
  our strategy and workflow.
  - _Root Cause:_ Insufficient upfront scoping and expectation alignment
  regarding data suitability, methodology, and deliverables before diving into
  analysis. This led to underestimation of the time and effort needed for data
  preparation and initial alignment.

- **Cross-Team Integration & Synthesis**  While both manual and NLP workflows
  were robust individually, integrating their outputs and synthesizing findings
  into a cohesive narrative proved more challenging and time-consuming than
  anticipated. The linkage, such as feeding quote extraction into NLP or using
  NLP insights to inform manual sampling, could have been tighter.
  - _Root Cause:_  A lack of a clearly defined integration plan at milestone
  start. Conceptual alignment, especially in new domains, takes dedicated time.

- **Asynchronous Communication & Time Zone Impact**
  Our differing time zones sometimes led to delays in decision-making and
  alignment, as critical discussions or shifts in direction occurred when some
  team members were offline. This made it harder to quickly catch up and stay
  fully aligned, particularly during quieter periods.
  - _Root Cause:_ Sub-optimal asynchronous communication protocols; while
  communication was generally good, the absence of specific shared agreements
  for offline decision-making and frequent, brief check-ins exacerbated time
  zone challenges and delayed issue identification.

- **Task Management & Workflow Clarity**
  We recognized a need for more detailed, step-by-step planning and clearer
  assignment of responsibilities from the outset to reduce confusion and
  maintain consistent alignment throughout the process.
  - _Root Cause:_ Despite having agendas, complex topics made it hard to
  timebox and assign clearly.

## Lessons Learned

- _**Data-Strategy Alignment is critical**_ early to avoid rework.
- _**Proactive Integration**_ between analysis streams should be built in from
  the start.
- _**Calibration is interpretive**, not just technical._
- _**Hybrid Methods reveal nuance + scale**, especially for lived experience data._
- _**Data Consistency** is foundational for efficient qualitative work._

> _"Calibration, both in coding and task planning, is crucial for building a
> shared interpretive framework that deepens team understanding and cohesion."

## Action Plan & Next Steps

As we move into the "Communicating Results" milestone, weâ€™re applying these
lessons to
make our next phase smoother and more focused, specifically in how we approach
our analysis.

- **Early Joint Alignment Session**  
  Schedule a dedicated, joint session with all team member to bridge
  qualitativeâ€“quantitative integration and clarify expectations.

- **Proactive Task Management**  
  Implement more robust, step-by-step planning and clearer assignment of
  responsibilities from the outset. This includes encouraging team members to
  submit exploration findings and ideas before meetings, allowing for
  pre-review and sharper discussions.

- **Structured Async Communication**  
  Establish clear protocols for communicating key decisions and task changes
  that occur when team members are offline, ensuring everyone stays aligned
  despite time zone differences. This could involve specific channels for
  updates or designated "catch-up" moments.

- **Frequent, Lightweight Check-ins**  
  Increase the frequency of brief check-ins to catch potential issues earlier,
  ensure consistent alignment, and distribute the workload more efficiently.

- **Define Analytical Outcomes Upfront**  
  Clarify the goals of each analysis task before diving in.
