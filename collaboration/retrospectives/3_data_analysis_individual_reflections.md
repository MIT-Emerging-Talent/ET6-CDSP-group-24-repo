## **Jola:**

**What went well during this Data Analysis Milestone?**

- We were able to successfully adopt a hybrid analytical approach that
  complemented each other well and enriched our insights.
- Team collaboration was generally strong, and we adapted quickly when we
  hit roadblocks.

**What could have gone better?**

- A meeting that was meant to finalize our approach unexpectedly shifted into a
  brainstorming session for new ideas. This delayed our alignment,
  and we ended up waiting almost a week to finalize our strategy.
- Some misalignment in expectations and delays in finalizing key steps
  impacted our timeline and workflow.

**What did you learn or discover during this milestone?**

- I discovered that I really enjoy research, although I’m still figuring
  out what kind I’m most drawn to.
- I learned about qualitative analytical methodologies, including manual
  coding, KWIC (Key Word in Context), NLP techniques, and topic modeling.
- I did a deep dive into thematic manual coding. It was both intellectually
  demanding and surprisingly fun.
- This milestone pushed me outside my comfort zone. It was very
  challenging, but ultimately rewarding.

**One concrete action for the next milestone!**

- Team members should submit their exploration findings and ideas ahead
  of each meeting, and also take time to review others’ contributions beforehand.
  This will make our discussions sharper and more productive.

**Additional thoughts:**  

- Honestly, the end of this milestone didn’t unfold how I envisioned. I
  think we could have been more polished in our process, especially earlier on,
  so we weren’t scrambling so close to the deadline.
- With better structure and early convergence, I believe we can produce
  even more refined and impactful results.

## **Karim:**

**What went well during this Data Analysis Milestone?**

- Applying different NLP techniques to analyze the data.
- Able to do two different analysis approaches, manual and automated analysis.

**What could have gone better?**

- I recommend improving our task management and step-by-step planning
  before diving into the analysis.
- Establishing a clearer workflow and assigning responsibilities early on
  would reduce confusion and help the team stay aligned throughout the process.

**What did you learn or discover during this milestone?**

- This milestone was a major learning opportunity. I deepened my
  understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and how it can be used to
  extract meaning from qualitative data.
- Learned different techniques to use qualitative data to analyze it such as
  Topic Modeling, Keyword Extraction and Keywords in context checks (KWIC).

**One concrete action for the next milestone!**

- I would recommend myself and my team to have a better way on task
  management and planning next steps, this is always very crucial in teamwork.

**Additional thoughts:**

- Overall, team collaboration was positive, but we could benefit from more
  regular check-ins and clearer communication. Aligning early on roles, goals
  and expectations could help us avoid missteps and distribute the workload
  more efficiently.

## **Muqadsa:**

**What went well during this Data Analysis Milestone?**

- Splitting our work into manual coding and automated analysis was highly
  effective, providing both in-depth detail and broad understanding.
- Our shared documents and proper issue tracking unified our efforts and
  brought significant clarity to a complex challenge.
- The manual coding sub-team found a great rhythm, efficiently working through ambiguities.
- We experienced some highly productive periods where work flowed very well.

**What could have gone better?**

- An early planning meeting unexpectedly shifted our focus when a mismatch in
  data relevance came to light. Addressing this took more time than
  anticipated, causing about a week's delay, as we worked through our
  misaligned expectations on the dataset.
- Being in a different time zone sometimes meant missing live decisions,
  making it harder to catch up and align quickly, especially during quieter periods.
- Time constraints often led us to work too close to the deadline, limiting the
  depth of cross-team integration.
- While manual and NLP workflows were solid individually, their linkage
  (e.g., quote extraction feeding NLP, NLP insights informing manual sampling
   could have been tighter.

**What did you learn or discover during this milestone?**

- Manual coding can uncover nuanced meaning—like tone, agency, and
  lived realities—that large-scale automation often misses.
- Calibration, both in coding and task planning, is crucial for building a
shared interpretive framework that deepens team understanding and cohesion.
Combining detailed manual analysis with broader automated techniques is
essential for uncovering both nuanced meanings and scalable patterns,
particularly when engaging with human stories.

**One concrete action for the next milestone!**

- I strongly recommend scheduling a dedicated, joint session with all
  team members very early in the next milestone to align on expectations
  and approach, and to unify ideas for final deliverables.
- To bridge time zone gaps, we should establish a clear process for
  communicating key decisions and task changes that occur when team members
  are offline, ensuring everyone stays aligned.

**Additional thoughts:**

- Team collaboration was consistently respectful, flexible, and resilient.
- I appreciated how we supported each other through uncertainty, whether
  clarifying codes or reviewing datasets.
- The culture of constructive, lightweight communication (via comments, flags,
  and async reviews) worked well.
- Overall, the team handled a complex task with care, integrity, and a shared
  sense of purpose.

## **Omer:**

**What went well during this Data Analysis Milestone?**

- During this milestone, I worked on manual coding and successfully learned how
  to apply the manual codebook. One achievement was improving my understanding
and confidence in using manual thematic coding.
- Additionally, although we faced some delays, the team put in effort to clean
  and reprocess the data properly, which improved the quality of our analysis.

**What could have gone better?**

- One main challenge was the delay caused by the need to clean and reformat
    the data again after discovering inconsistencies.
- It also took some time for the team to align on coding practices, especially
  for texts that were difficult to categorize clearly.

**What did you learn or discover during this milestone?**

- I learned how to apply manual coding effectively using a structured codebook.
- I also gained experience in data cleaning and became more aware of how
  crucial consistent formatting is for qualitative analysis.
- Additionally, I learned from team discussions how to better justify and
  adjust codes based on feedback.

**One concrete action for the next milestone!**

- I recommend improving time management and making sure all previous milestones
  are clearly connected and aligned before we begin.

**Additional thoughts:**

- Overall, the team worked well together, and there was good communication,
  especially when resolving coding differences.
- However, it would be helpful if we can schedule brief check-ins more
  frequently to catch issues earlier and align more consistently.
