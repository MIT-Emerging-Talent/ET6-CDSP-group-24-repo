## Jola's Reflection

**What went well during this Data Collection Milestone?**

- We maintained a strong sense of collective ownership and self-leadership.
- We shared ideas freely and maintained openness.
- We curated a wide range of qualitative and unstructured data from credible
  sources using a thematic approach.
- A clear workflow for data collection and documentation was established early,
  which made it easier to complete our deliverables.

**What could have gone better?**

- We didn’t always consider the broader implications of our decisions. For
  example, our initial focus on structured data constrained our scope and
  caused delays once we realized its limitations.
- Our workflow planning could have been more forward-thinking. Defining
  follow-up steps after key decisions might have helped us avoid bottlenecks.

**What did you learn or discover during this milestone?**

- Discovered the relevance of qualitative data, especially in contexts where
  structured data is inadequate.
- Developed stronger research skills like how to identify credible sources, use
  effective keyword strategies, and collect relevant data.
- Learned the importance of documentation approaches that evolve with the
  nature of the data.
- Saw firsthand how early decisions have ripple effects on the rest of the
  workflow, underscoring the value of proactive planning.

**One concrete action for the next milestone!**

- Before working on the next milestone, thoroughly review the guide in the repo
  and ask any necessary clarifying questions to ensure full understanding.
- After every major team decision, take a moment to define:
  - potential risks or limitations of that choice, and
  - the next two concrete steps that flow from it.

**Additional thoughts:**

- Keep up the open, collaborative and learning spirit! It’s been a strong
  foundation for our progress so far.

## Karim's Reflection

**What went well during this Data Collection Milestone?**

- Meeting attendance was great and almost every meeting had all team members present.
- After thorough planning, we successfully determined the correct data type to collect.
- The collaboration work went so smooth and every step had a separate document
  which helped keep the collaborative work organized.
- Increased use of Slack helped keep everyone informed of important updates and announcements.

**What could have gone better?**

- Discussions often ran longer than planned, leading to extended meetings.
- The process of refining the research question was unclear at times, causing
  delays in finalizing the direction.
- Due to limited familiarity with qualitative data, we initially focused on
  quantitative data, only to later realize it might not be feasible for our
  research question.

**What did you learn or discover during this milestone?**

- Explored various data sources and tools for effective data collection.
- Gained skills on how to look for data and how to know which kind of data is
  suitable for a research question.
- Gained insights into team collaboration dynamics in a data science project.

**One concrete action for the next milestone!**

- Pre-study unfamiliar topics – dedicate time to understand new concepts (e.g.,
  qualitative vs. quantitative data).
- Improve meeting efficiency – If a topic requires extensive discussion, split
  it into multiple structured sessions.

**Additional thoughts:**

- Keep using Slack for important announcements.
- If a discussion doesn’t require real-time input, consider using WhatsApp or
  shared documents to reduce meeting overload.

## Muqadsa's Reflection

**What went well during this Data Collection Milestone?**

- Communication within the team remained open and collaborative, which kept
  things moving—even when decisions required iteration.
- Individual tasks were generally clear and well-scoped.
- The **case-based approach** we developed helped anchor our data collection in
  a shared structure, providing clarity and direction.
- As a team, we adapted well to modeling qualitative data—shifting from
  unstructured text to a thematic schema was new for many of us, and we
  navigated that with care.
- Everyone stayed engaged and supportive throughout, creating momentum,
  cohesion, and a sense of collective ownership.

**What could have gone better?**

- Aligning on **final outputs and shared expectations**—especially as things
  evolved—took more iteration than expected, even with some workflows in place.
- Sometimes, we needed to repeat or revisit key points that could have been
  captured more consistently in shared notes or documents.
- A clearer discussion and follow-through on "must-have" versus "nice-to-have"
  tasks could have improved task prioritization. While the allure of adding
  extra polish is understandable, for a small team, ensuring our collective
  efforts are focused on **what truly matters** first is crucial for efficient
  progress and for **building a strong sense of shared purpose.**

**What did you learn or discover during this milestone?**

- I developed a clearer understanding of how to structure qualitative data for
  insight extraction in under-documented domains.
- I realized the value of **clarity and consistency** in evolving schemas—not
  just for organization, but for enabling meaningful analysis.
- I learned the importance of **early alignment** on what a “final output” looks
  like, both in content and level of polish.
- I came to appreciate how effective documentation (e.g., shared summaries,
  live notes) can reduce friction and prevent avoidable repetition.

**One concrete action for the next milestone!**

- I will support clearer expectation-setting by:
  - Helping to flag **“must-haves” vs. “nice-to-have”** more explicitly during
  task definition.
  - Summarizing key decisions and expected outputs after key calls or check-ins.

**Additional thoughts:**

- The collaboration was genuinely positive and supportive, which made the
  process smoother—even when we hit bumps.
- There’s room to refine how we sync expectations and document shared knowledge,
  but the **overall team dynamic was strong**, and I’m grateful for that.

  successful businesses, providing rich qualitative data.
- We leveraged institutional databases and open-access archives to gather
  high-quality content.
- Task distribution among team members was effective, which clarified direction
  and deepened understanding.

**What could have gone better?**

- Initially, the focus was mainly on quantitative data, but we later realized
  the value of qualitative data and had to adjust.
- Organizing materials thematically was time-consuming due to varying formats
  and depth.
- Assessing credibility of some open-source materials was challenging and
  required extra steps.

**What did you learn or discover during this milestone?**

## Robel's Reflection

**What went well during this Data Collection Milestone?**

- We had at least found some datasets regarding structured and unstructured datasets
- Identify and collect relevant reports, case studies, and articles from
  international development organizations, NGOs, and academic institutions.
- Collaborate effectively as a team to organize, annotate, and prioritize data
  under time constraints.
- Maintain alignment with our core research question, which helped us stay
  focused on collecting data that would be meaningful and actionable.

**What could have gone better?**

- While we gathered valuable unstructured insights, we lacked the resources to
  conduct surveys or interviews that could have yielded structured,
  quantifiable datasets.
- Searching for relevant datasets — especially in underexplored domains like
  disability-inclusive entrepreneurship — demanded a good deal of skill in
  framing queries, identifying credible sources, and interpreting complex materials.
- Some potentially valuable datasets were behind paywalls, required ethical
  clearance, or were accessible only to institutions with formal partnerships.
  These barriers limited our ability to incorporate more structured or
  comparative data.
- Early engagement with domain experts could have helped us validate
  assumptions, guide thematic focus, and refine the structure of our data.
  Scheduling limitations made this difficult.

**What did you learn or discover during this milestone?**

- Our research sits at the intersection of disability, entrepreneurship,
  digital technology, and Sub-Saharan African development — a space with very
  limited integrated data. We learned how to work across disciplines and
  synthesize fragmented knowledge into a coherent thematic model.
- We discovered that qualitative sources — like case studies, articles, and NGO
  reports — can offer rich, context-specific insights. However, we also saw
  their limits in terms of generalizability, verifiability, and structure for analysis.
- Realized that research design must adapt to practical constraints (time,
  access, funding).

**One concrete action for the next milestone!**

- To involve a domain expert or data advisor early in the process to help
  refine our research questions and guide efficient data strategies. This will
  ensure we focus on the most impactful insights, streamline our analysis of
  unstructured data, and avoid misalignment between our research goals and
  available evidence.
- we are still working on being more precise and consistent with the duration
  and detail of our meeting minutes, but we are committed to improving this
  in the upcoming milestone to enhance team coordination and documentation
