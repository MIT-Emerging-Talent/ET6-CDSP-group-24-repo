# **Milestone Retrospective: Communicating Results**

This milestone was about **sharing our research findings with the audiences
who can use them** —
translating the insights from our recent data analysis into messages, visuals,
and tools our audiences could connect with and act on.

We worked across formats: a narrative landing page, tailored recommendations,
visual data stories, and a downloadable report. The focus was on balancing
**creativity with clarity**, tailoring content for decision-makers while staying
true to the evidence.

Our work was shaped by constant feedback, iteration, and a shared goal
of making our findings both **credible and compelling**.

## **Key Achievements**

* **Regained focus after a slow start:** While momentum was low at first, we
  collectively refocused, agreed on the landing page as our central artifact,
  and rallied to deliver strong outputs.

* **Purpose-driven alignment:** Once the central artifact was decided, our
  messaging and design choices became sharper and more audience-focused.

* **Stronger follow-through from past lessons:** We applied planning and role
  clarity strategies from earlier milestones, leading to more cohesive outputs.

* **Audience-aware recommendations:** Recommendations and outreach concepts
  were designed with specific priority audiences in mind, keeping them
  relevant and actionable.

* **Leveraging diverse strengths:** We trusted each other’s expertise, which
  allowed people to lead in the areas they knew best — from data visuals and
  narrative writing to design and outreach strategy.

* **Collaborative iteration:** Feedback was respectful and useful, helping
  us improve quality while still moving the work forward.

## **Challenges Faced**

We learned a lot from the difficulties encountered during this milestone.
Understanding these challenges helps us identify areas for growth.

* **Slow initial momentum:** Energy was lower at the start of the milestone.  
  _Root Cause:_ Overlap with previous deliverables and presentation prep, plus
  residual fatigue from the prior milestone, delayed full focus on Milestone 4 work.

* **Maintaining focus amid parallel tasks:** Working on the presentation pulled
  attention away at points.  
  _Root Cause:_ Scheduling overlap between milestone and group presentation reduced
  available deep-work time.

* **Narrowing audience focus:** Relevance to multiple groups made
  prioritization difficult, as we debated whether to include adjacent advocacy
  audiences (e.g., journalists, disability rights advocates) alongside our chosen
  social good organisations.  
  _Root Cause:_ Balancing reach and specificity required repeated revisiting of
  the audience scope.

* **Late-stage realizations:** Some refinements to artifacts and deliverables
  only became clear near the deadline, which left less time for polish.  
  _Root Cause:_ Final review feedback surfaced gaps only after most production
  work was complete.

* **Balancing ambition with capacity:** Creative ideas for visuals and
  formats couldn’t all be executed.  
  _Root Cause:_ Limited time and technical familiarity restricted experimentation.

## **Lessons Learned**

Based on our achievements and challenges, here are the key takeaways and
insights we gained:

* **Resilience pays off:** Even after a slow start, committing to achievable
  wins helped the team rebuild momentum and finish strong.

* **Define audience early:** Locking in the “who” and “how” of communication
  before content creation makes the rest of the process smoother and more
  impactful.

* **Brainstorm visuals early:** Scheduling early creative sessions on how to
  present findings can prevent missed opportunities and rushed last-minute
  design work.

* **Check in beyond tasks:** Regularly asking if teammates feel supported —
  not just whether tasks are on track — strengthens trust and team morale.

* **Structure supports outreach:** A clear, systematic approach to stakeholder
  engagement (including message framing and targeting) improves both quality
  and confidence in delivery.

## **Action Plan & Next Steps**

As we transition into the **Final Presentation Event**, we commit to
applying the lessons learned to improve our processes and outcomes.

* **Start early:** Begin developing the presentation narrative and visuals in
  week 1 of the milestone to avoid last-minute rush.

* **Anchor in audience needs:** Tailor our 1-minute pitch and 3-minute process
  presentation to engage peers, and ET team and partners, while keeping the
  policy relevance clear.

* **Leverage our artifacts:** Integrate highlights from the landing page,
  recommendations, and visuals into the live presentation for consistency and
  credibility.

* **Balance prep and assign clear roles:** Coordinate workload for the final
  presentation and decide early who will handle which parts, slides, and Q&A.

* **Keep momentum with small wins:** Set micro-deadlines for slide completion,
  run-throughs, and feedback cycles to maintain energy throughout the milestone.

* **Continue collaborative feedback:** Keep using shared documents and
  comments for centralized, constructive input.

This milestone reminded us that our audience’s needs shape not just the
message, but how we deliver it — together, with clarity and purpose.”_
