# **Milestone Retrospective: Final Presentation**

This milestone was about **bringing our entire project to a close** — distilling
months of research, analysis, and artifact design into a clear, compelling, and
memorable 2.5-minute pitch.

Unlike earlier milestones, this phase was less about producing new outputs and
more about **shaping delivery**: choosing the right words, visuals, and timing
to tell our story with clarity and confidence. It was the moment where all the
threads — from problem identification to communication strategy — came together
in one performance that represented our shared journey.

## **Key Achievements**

* **Strong narrative focus:** We crafted a script that combined research
  credibility with human-centered storytelling, making complex barriers easy to
  grasp.
* **Slide design that worked with delivery:** Minimal, accessible slides
  supported the message rather than distracting from it, helping judges follow
  the flow.

* **Clear division of roles:** Splitting responsibilities across script, slide
  design, and delivery meant each person could play to their strengths.
* **Audience-aware framing:** Recommendations were tailored for NGO officers,
  funders, and policymakers, while keeping the “design for the margins” message
  broad and memorable.
* **Finishing together:** Even with fatigue setting in, the team coordinated
  feedback, integrated revisions, and arrived at a polished final presentation.

## **Challenges Faced**

* **Balancing detail and brevity:** Compressing months of work into 2.5 minutes
  meant cutting content we valued. This was frustrating at times, but necessary
  to keep the story sharp.

* **Energy dips:** After weeks of sustained effort, morale and energy were
  lower, which sometimes slowed down reviews and decision-making.
* **Feedback interpretation:** During the final editing phase, we learned that
  what one person sees as a small tweak, another might see as a big change.
We realised we have to make sure everyone is on the same page with each round
of edits.
* **Time pressure:** Final revisions happened close to the deadline, leaving
  little margin for extra rehearsal or experimentation with delivery.

*These challenges reflected the natural ebb of a three-month project — with
personal commitments, dips in energy, and tight timelines all affecting how we
closed things out.*

## **Lessons Learned**

* **Clarity beats coverage:** A short pitch works best when every line lands —
  fewer points, delivered with confidence, are more powerful than trying to
  include everything.

* **Performance is part of the work:** A good script on paper isn’t enough.
  Practicing delivery and hearing it aloud early can surface pacing, tone, and
  emphasis issues that text alone won’t show.
* **Frame feedback early and clearly:** Signaling whether a suggestion is polish
  or
  structural avoids confusion and keeps editing cycles smoother.
* **Support matters in late stages:** When fatigue sets in, encouragement and
  focused priorities keep momentum alive.
* **Plan around energy and commitments:** In multi-month projects, team energy
naturally fluctuates and personal commitments arise. Building in lighter
check-ins and flexible task allocation helps sustain momentum
without adding pressure.

## **Action Plan & Next Steps**

While this was our final milestone, the lessons carry forward:

* **Invest in rehearsals:** Build in earlier timed run-throughs so delivery can
  be refined with confidence.

* **Keep audience central:** Every decision — from slides to examples — should
  filter through “what will land most with this audience?”
* **Simplify visuals:** One clear image or keyword is more memorable than a
  text-heavy slide.
* **Celebrate the finish:** Taking time to recognize progress helped close the
  project on a positive note — a practice worth carrying into future
  collaborations.
