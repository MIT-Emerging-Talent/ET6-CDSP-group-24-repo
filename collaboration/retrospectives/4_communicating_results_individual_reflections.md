# Individual Retrospectives – Milestone 4: Communicating Results

This document brings together each team member’s personal reflections from the
Communicating Results milestone.
These accounts capture what worked well, the specific challenges we faced, and
the lessons learned along the way.

Each perspective offers a unique take on how we approached sharing our findings
— from crafting narrative-driven artifacts to designing audience-tailored materials.
Together, they provide a richer backdrop to our group retrospective, showing
the range of experiences, skills, and insights gained during this phase.

## Jola's Reflection

**What went well?**

- Teamwork and synergy were on point

**What were the challenges?**

- We did not start early enough, perhaps because we were distracted by the
  presentation. As such, I believe we could have strengthened/refined the
  artefact if we had more time.
- We struggled a bit to present a grounded, emotional resonant and trustworthy
  narrative in our communication.

**What did you learn or discover?**

- When it comes to communicating your findings, you have to think audience first.
- In our case, an emotionally resonant and grounded approach, which even
  amplifies grassroots initiative or community networks already doing the work,
  will connect more to our audience.

**What’s one thing you’ll do differently next time?**

- Start early.

**Any final thoughts on collaboration?**

- Collaboration was great. Each member was responsive and dedicated to their
  tasks, even delivering more than expected. Beyond that, we also helped each
  other with respective tasks, and focused on the goal rather than just
  completing personal assignments.

## Karim's Reflection

**What went well?**

- We aligned as a team on a single main communication artifact (the landing
  page) after exploring different options.
- The discussion connected the artifact design to specific audiences and
  findings, making our approach more purposeful.

**What were the challenges?**

- We had difficulty defining the right target audience and especially narrowing
  it down, since we initially had very different audiences in mind touching
  different findings.

**What did you learn or discover?**

- Having one clear, narrative-focused artifact can be more impactful than
  trying to spread efforts across too many formats.
- Tying communication formats directly to audience needs and constraints makes
  planning easier and more targeted.

**What’s one thing you’ll do differently next time?**

- Make earlier decisions on audience and artifact format so we can dedicate
  more time to production and outreach.

**Any final thoughts on collaboration?**

- The mix of perspectives in the team has been really valuable for shaping both
  personas and artifact ideas.
- Using shared documents was especially effective — it kept our work
  organized, made it easier to contribute asynchronously, and was a key factor
  in keeping the project moving smoothly.

## Muqadsa's Reflection

**What went well?**

- Our feedback process was genuinely constructive. We improved the quality of
  our work through open, thoughtful exchanges—without creating tension or
  slowing things down.

**What were the challenges?**

- We could have made more space early in the milestone to brainstorm creative
  ways to visualize our data.
- Also, defining smaller internal deadlines upfront might have helped us
  manage time better toward the end.

**What did you learn or discover?**

- I learned that regular check-ins shouldn’t just be about tasks—they’re also
  a moment to ask if a teammate feels supported.
- I learned that even with a clear deliverable, taking the time to discuss
  the underlying definitions and purpose of a task is crucial for team alignment.
- And I came away with a deep appreciation for how powerful persona-driven
  communication can be.

**What’s one thing you’ll do differently next time?**

- I’d encourage us to use the “Comments” feature in our shared docs more often.
  It helps centralize feedback and keeps our chat threads focused.

**Any final thoughts on collaboration?**

- I really appreciated how everyone trusted each other’s strengths, and we
  created space to explore different approaches without friction.

## Omnia's Reflection

**What went well?**

- The team showed resilience and adaptability - after a slow start, we
  regrouped and delivered strong work when it mattered most.
- Our final deliverables demonstrated clear improvement from the previous
  milestone, showing we learned from past experiences and applied those lessons
  effectively.

**What were the challenges?**

- Initial momentum was slow and the team felt somewhat demotivated at the
  beginning of this milestone due to previous setbacks.
- There was less of the collaborative energy and synergy we had experienced in
  earlier milestones, which affected our initial progress.

**What did you learn or discover?**

- I learned that teams can recover from low points if members are willing to
  refocus and recommit to the work - resilience is a key team skill.
- Following Muqadsa's insight, I discovered how important it is to check in on
  teammates' well-being and support, not just task progress.

**What’s one thing you’ll do differently next time?**

- I will suggest we establish early momentum by setting smaller, achievable
  wins at the start of each milestone to maintain team morale and energy throughout.

**Any final thoughts on collaboration?**

- While we started slower than usual, I'm proud that the team was able to rally
  and deliver quality work. It showed our underlying strength as a
  collaborative unit, even when facing motivation challenges.

## Robel's Reflection

**What went well?**

- We had good team work and everybody was working on their task.
- We understood this milestone earlier as compared to the previous one and
  made the best out of it.

**What were the challenges?**

- As always, we keep on realizing things around the due dates on how the
  artifacts and the deliverables are.
- Balancing limited time against insufficient knowledge was another challenge
  which complicated our efforts to develop communication artifacts cohesively
  and avoid diverging from our core objectives.

**What did you learn or discover?**

- I have Learned to structure compelling cold messages for stakeholders engagement
- I have also learned how to systematically identify stakeholders based on
  research goals.

**What’s one thing you’ll do differently next time?**

- Try to sharpen our thoughts and get ready for the second and final phase
  presentation because we have learned from the previous one.
- Also as always, we will try to finish our meetings on their respective times.

**Any final thoughts on collaboration?**

- Our identity as learners + our work's dual focus + The translation imperative
  = Artifacts with purpose.
