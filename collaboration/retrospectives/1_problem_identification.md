# Milestone Retrospective: Problem Identification

This milestone, **"A Big Picture of Data Science,"** was all about shaping the
foundation of our project. We explored themes, conducted literature reviews,
and narrowed down to a focused research question. This challenging yet
rewarding journey highlighted our team's strength in mutual support and
commitment.

Along the way, we engaged in a range of collaborative activities—such as
brainstorming sessions, individual and group literature reviews, and team
discussions to align on our direction. While these activities aren't listed in
a separate section, they're reflected throughout the reflections below. They
shaped not just our outputs, but how we worked together, navigated uncertainty,
and learned as a team.

## Key Achievements

- **Team Spirit and Collaboration:** From the beginning, our team brought
  positive energy and an openness to work together. Whether clarifying ideas or
  offering feedback, everyone showed care and dedication.

- **Mutual Appreciation:** We regularly acknowledged each other’s effort and
  hard work. This mutual respect helped us stay motivated through tough moments.

- **Commitment to the Process:** Even when it was difficult to agree on a
  research focus, we didn’t give up. Through open dialogue and persistence, we
  eventually aligned on a clear question—showing our shared dedication.

- **Openness to Dialogue:** We kept conversations flowing, even when topics
  felt abstract or challenging. This openness built trust and allowed multiple
  perspectives to surface, which helped us move forward.

## Challenges Faced

Much of what we learned came through the process itself—how we reviewed,
talked through, and tried to make sense of things together. That said, a few
patterns stood out as areas we can improve. In many cases, the challenges we
faced stemmed directly from how we approached those activities—what worked
well, and what didn’t.

- **Misaligned Interpretations of the Problem Space:** We discovered that
  "Economic Inclusion" meant different things to each of us. This lack of shared
  definition created confusion and slowed our ability to connect individual ideas
  to the overall vision.
  - *Root Cause:* We didn’t spend enough time upfront defining key terms or
  aligning our scope.

- **Unstructured Brainstorming:** Without a shared process, idea generation felt
  scattered. It was hard to evaluate or build on each other's input effectively.
  - *Root Cause:* Lack of structured brainstorming tools or facilitation methods
  in early stages.

- **Synthesis Was Harder Than Expected:** Despite using templates and a workflow
for literature review and synthesis, pulling our findings into a clear, unified
direction still felt overwhelming.  
  - *Root Cause:* Too much information without shared guidance for synthesis or
  prioritization.

- **Meeting Fatigue:** Even with agendas, time allocations, and reminders in
  place, some meetings—especially toward the end—ran long or lost focus.
  Discussing abstract ideas took a lot of energy, and it was hard to maintain
  momentum or clarity throughout.  
  - *Root Cause:* While we had tools to guide meetings, the nature of the
  discussions often made it difficult to stay within time or keep everyone
  equally engaged.

- **Tough Alignment on Final Question:** Narrowing down to a unified research
  question took more time than expected. Everyone brought valid ideas, but
  merging them into a focused, meaningful direction was challenging.  
  - *Root Cause:* We underestimated the emotional and cognitive effort involved
  in alignment and consensus-building.

## Lessons Learned

- **Shared Understanding First:** Assumptions about common focus can be
  misleading without explicit conversation. We need to start future work with
  clear definitions and aligned expectations.

- **Structure Supports Creativity:** Brainstorming and synthesis work best with
  scaffolding—like templates, checklists, and shared criteria.

- **Build in Iteration:** Progress isn't always linear. We need space to revisit
  our definitions, refine questions, and adapt as we uncover new insights.

- **Timeboxing & Pre-Work Matter:** Meetings run better when we prepare in
  advance and keep discussions time-bound.

- **Alignment Takes Time (and Patience):** Real alignment isn't instant. It
  requires empathy, discussion, and shared evaluation criteria to turn a group
  of ideas into a group decision.

## Action Plan & Next Steps

As we move into the **"Data Collection"** milestone, we’re applying these
lessons to make our next phase smoother and more focused.

- **Define Our Data Needs Upfront:** Just like we aligned on our topic, we’ll
  now agree on what “good data” looks like—formats, sources, and key variables—
  before we start collecting.

- **Proactive Data Exploration:** Each of us will explore possible datasets. If
  we find gaps, we’ll raise them early and brainstorm workarounds together.

- **Structure Our Discussions:** We’ll bring clear goals into every meeting—
  whether it's prioritizing sources, reviewing variables, or solving data issues
  —so discussions lead to action.

- **Pre-Work Is a Must:** We’ll prep before meetings by reading shared docs,
  scanning sources, and coming ready. This will help keep meetings efficient and
  engaging.

- **Expect the Unexpected:** Data work often brings surprises. We'll build in
  extra time for cleaning, checks, and exploration, with quick check-ins to stay
  on track.

> Thanks to everyone for their persistence and collaboration. We've laid the
> foundation for stronger technical and strategic work by being honest about our
> process. Let’s bring this same energy—*now with a few more tools*—into the next
> phase.
