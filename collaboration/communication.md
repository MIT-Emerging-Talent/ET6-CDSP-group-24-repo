## 📡 Communication Channels

Effective communication is the heartbeat of this project. Below are the platforms
 and how we'll use them:

- **📌 GitHub Issues**:  
  For assigning tasks, managing backlogs, writing meeting agendas, and tracking
   deliverables through the project board.

- **🔃 Pull Requests**:  
  Used for code review, collaboration, and discussions around technical implementation.

- **📣 Slack** *(as needed)*:  
  Our semi-formal space for announcements, milestone updates, and group coordination.

- **💬 WhatsApp** *(daily check-ins)*:  
  A quick channel for real-time coordination, informal updates, and peer support.

- **🎥 Google Meet** *(weekly or ad hoc)*:  
  For planning sessions, sprint reviews, retrospectives, and deeper technical or
   strategic discussions.

> Let’s maintain clarity, responsiveness, and trust — because communication is
> what turns effort into execution.
