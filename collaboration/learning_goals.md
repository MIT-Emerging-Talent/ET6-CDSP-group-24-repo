## Collective Learning Goals

As a diverse team of emerging data scientists, we aim to:

1. **Identify and Frame Real-World Problems**  
   - Learn to define clear problem statements and hypotheses based on real socio-economic,
  community, or business challenges.  
   - Practice translating complex issues into structured data science questions.

2. **Develop and Apply Technical Skills**  
   - Strengthen our skills in Python programming, data collection, wrangling,
  and exploratory analysis.  
   - Apply machine learning and analytical methods to extract actionable insights
  from real-world datasets.

3. **Manage and Collaborate on Projects**  
   - Gain experience managing a data science project from ideation to delivery,
  using collaborative coding practices.  
   - Improve our ability to work effectively as a remote team through communication,
   documentation, and agile workflows.

4. **Integrate Business and Social Impact Thinking**  
   - Learn to combine data science with domain knowledge, engineering logic,
  and business strategy.  
   - Focus on creating practical, socially meaningful, and scalable solutions.

5. **Communicate Data Insights Effectively**  
   - Improve our ability to communicate findings clearly to technical and
  non-technical audiences.  
   - Use visualizations, storytelling, and structured reporting
   to present solutions with real-world impact.
