## Meeting Purpose & Rationale

- This meeting served as the true kick-off for Milestone 2.
- **Strategic Decision – Pivot to a Data-First Approach**

  - The team thoroughly discussed several possible strategies to narrow
  our broad research question
(e.g., starting with region, disability, or technology, or vice-versa).
  - Ultimately, given the current vastness of our research question and the
  tight 2-month project timeline, the team collectively opted for a
  **data-first** approach to ensure our final question is both feasible and impactful.
  - Key rationale for this pivot:

    - Prioritize available **secondary and proxy datasets**.
    - Avoid time-intensive **primary data collection**.
    - Ground the research in **real-world data availability** to reduce risk.

- It was collectively agreed that dedicating sufficient time to this exploration
 phase early on will save significant time downstream and reduce rework.

## Discussion & Outcomes

- **Pivot to Data-First Exploration:** The team agreed to prioritize actively
  searching for datasets and assessing their availability/relevance. This
  exploration will directly inform the subsequent refinement of our actionable
  research question.

- **Data Documentation Template:** Karim will finalize a template for documenting
  discovered datasets, which will incorporate discussions around the structure
  shared by Muqadsa to ensure its helpfulness and focus.

- **Guidance for Data Hunting:** Refer to the existing
  research question breakdown documents prepared by @MuqadsaT and @KarimMakki for
  general guidance while searching for datasets.

- **Future Expert Consultation:**
  It was discussed that after this initial data exploration and a clearer
  understanding of data availability, the team may identify questions where
  expert input could support synthesis and interpretation of findings.
