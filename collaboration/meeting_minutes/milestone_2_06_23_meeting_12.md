## Meeting Purpose & Rationale

- To review the available data, assess its constraints, determine strategies for
handling unstructured data, establish a clear action plan for the remaining

include non-qualitative data types (images, videos, etc.).

  - Current data availability and constraints
  - Identified gaps in available data
- Assigned Jola-Moses as the 1-minute speaker for the Milestone 2 checkup session.
- Made decision to refine and narrow our research question for greater specificity.
- We had chosen Sub-Saharan Africa as the underserved region for our research question.
- Decided to create a new workflow for data collection.
