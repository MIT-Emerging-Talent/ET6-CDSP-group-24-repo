## Discussion Structure & Decisions

Todayâ€™s meeting focused on defining our **target audience** for Milestone 4 and
resolving key team concerns around **audience scope, communication framing,**
and **research grounding**. We recognized that:

- Our findings span **tech design**, **infrastructure**, and **policy**, which
  complicates audience targeting.
- **Overextension risks diluting the message**, but being too narrow could
  misrepresent our results.
- We want our communication to be **impactful yet nuanced**, without overstating
  certainty or misattributing responsibility.

This led to the following guiding questions:

- Should we **target multiple stakeholder groups** (e.g., tech designers,
  policymakers, civil society) or **create distinct artifacts** for each?
- Can we **surface systemic patterns** (e.g., inaccessible platforms) **without
  naming specific companies or governments**, especially since our project
  spans the **SSA region** rather than a single country?
- How **specific or broad** should our primary audience be? Whatâ€™s the right
  balance between **real-world relevance** and **research integrity**?
- What level of **concreteness vs. narrative framing** is expected in our
  final communication artifact?

We agreed that these questions must be clarified **before** we move into
persona-building and artifact creation. Once we receive guidance, weâ€™ll
proceed with clearer, evidence-aligned decisions.
