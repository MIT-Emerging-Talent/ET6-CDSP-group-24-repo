## 1. Meeting Purpose & Structure

The group convened to ensure everyone
understands our manual coding
process and to map out how it
will integrate with an automated
NLP workflow. We confirmed that all
participants had read the
coding‐workflow document
beforehand, then moved through:

- A walkthrough of the full manual
workflow, clarifying phases and sub‑phases
(data cleaning, codebook
creation, intercoder calibration,
actual coding, and
interpretation).
- A discussion of overlaps and
handoffs between manual coding
and NLP tasks, aiming to split
responsibilities so each person
focuses on specific deliverables.
- Assignment of concrete next
steps—drafting an overall analysis
timeline, setting deadlines, and
scheduling the next check‑in.

## 2. Manual Thematic Coding (Jola’s Overview)

Manual coding was presented as
a depth-oriented approach that
allows for nuanced interpretation
and context sensitivity, especially
useful for subtle or emergent themes
that NLP may miss.

- **Codebook Creation:** Define a fixed
list of high‑level codes
(e.g. “Access Barrier,” “Inclusive Technology”),
their precise definitions, example
quotes, and notes on when/when
not to apply each.
- **Calibration:** Conduct intercoder
reliability checks on a small
sample to surface and resolve
differing interpretations before
full coding begins.
- **Line‑by‑Line Coding:** In a shared spreadsheet,
each coder pulls text excerpts,
tags them with code and
(optionally) subcode, notes source
document and location, and adds
comments for any ambiguities.
- **Analysis & Synthesis:** After everyone codes
their assigned documents, the
team reconvenes to examine code
frequencies, overlaps, and
emerging patterns, then distills
these into insights and draft report sections.

## 3. Automated NLP Workflow (Karim’s Plan)

The NLP workflow was outlined as
a scale-oriented and pattern-seeking
approach that complements manual
coding by identifying latent
structures and validating common
themes across larger datasets.

- **Data Extraction & Cleaning:** Pull raw
text from PDFs, transcripts, and
web articles; normalize case; remove
punctuation, stopwords, and
digits; tokenize and lemmatize.
- **Organizing Text:** Apply part‑of‑speech
tagging and named‑entity recognition
to structure the data and identify
people, organizations, dates, etc.
- **Feature Extraction:** Run keyword‐and‐phrase extraction to surface
the most salient terms and
co‑occurrence networks that
reveal term relationships.
- **Topic Modeling:** Use algorithms (e.g. LDA) to discover clusters of
terms corresponding to themes
and subthemes, mirroring
the manual codes.
- **Integration:** Compare and reconcile
the NLP‑derived themes with
the manually coded data, using
the automated output to prioritize,
validate, or refine the human analysis.

## 4. Next Steps

- Finalize and distribute the detailed
timeline for both manual and NLP tasks.
- Assign individual coding
and preprocessing responsibilities.
- Confirm shared tracking sheet
layout and set milestones for
interim calibration checks.
- Schedule our next progress review.

## Key Note

Karim noted that he plans to
prepare a final hybrid plan
outlining the week-by-week
integration of manual coding and
NLP work. The aim is to provide
a clear, actionable roadmap. Once
drafted, it will be shared with
the team for review and feedback.
