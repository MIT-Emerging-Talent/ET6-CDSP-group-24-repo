## 🔄 Adjustments & Decisions

### 🔍 1. Scope and Themes *(60 minutes)*  

Following our initial discussion, the team made several adjustments to narrow  
our focus and clarify our direction.

- **Domain Focus:** We have broadened our primary domain from Financial  
  Inclusion to the more comprehensive field of Economic Inclusion. This allows  
  us to consider factors beyond just financial products.

- **Primary Themes:** After evaluating several options, the team has decided to  
  concentrate on two primary themes:

  *Most of the ideas we discussed will fall under one of these themes — or sit  
  at the intersection between them.*

  - **Entrepreneurship & Economic Mobility:**  
    Exploring what helps or hinders people — especially in underserved  
    communities — to start businesses, access better jobs, and take more control  
    of their economic futures. This includes:  
    - Building practical skills (e.g., financial literacy, legal basics,  
      resilience) through AI, game-based learning, or mentorship  
    - Understanding what drives or blocks entrepreneurial behavior, including  
      psychological barriers and systemic challenges  
    - Studying how networks, role models, and localized support impact  
      motivation and success  

  - **Digital Inclusion:**  
    Looking at how digital access, tools, and usage shape people’s ability to  
    participate in the economy and society. That means:  
    - Exploring the impact of mobile tech, local-language AI, and offline-first  
      tools  
    - Understanding how people learn, transact, and make decisions in digital  
      vs offline settings  
    - Designing tech that actually fits people’s real lives — especially in  
      low-resource or low-connectivity environments  

- **Secondary Areas of Interest:** While not our primary focus, the following  
  areas may inform our research and will be considered where they intersect  
  with our main themes:  
  - Disability and Accessibility  
  - Financial Inclusion (specifically Microfinance)

### 🚀 2. Next Steps & Action Plan *(30 minutes)*  

The immediate goal is to conduct preliminary research to build a foundational  
understanding of our chosen themes.

- **Research Focus:** Our initial research will aim to identify:  
  - Key populations affected within our themes  
  - The most significant existing challenges and barriers  
  - Relevant case studies or successful interventions  
  - Gaps in current research and potential opportunities for our project  

- **Action Items:**  
  - [ ] Craft a research template to standardize findings  
  - [ ] Design a research and documentation workflow  
  - [ ] Begin preliminary research on **Entrepreneurship & Economic Mobility**  
  - [ ] Begin preliminary research on **Digital Inclusion**
