# Meeting Minutes #21 - Final Presentation Prep & Communications Deliverables

**Date:** Thursday, July 30, 2025

**Time:** 9:30 AM EST

**Platform:** Google Meet

**Attendees:** Jola, Karim, Omnia, Omer, Muqadsa, Robel

## 1. Check-ins (10 minutes)

* Some team members confirmed progress on their respective analysis tasks, with
  data triangulation complete.
* The team expressed readiness to move into final presentation and documentation
stages along with slides editing.

## 2. Presentation Slide Editing - Final Touches

* **Omnia was editing the slides while Karim was helping her.**
* During this process, **Evan came in and gave us some advice on how our Venn
  diagram should look like, and provided clarity on how to mention the 'digital
  point' effectively from the first slide.**
* The team reviewed the current state of the presentation scripts for overall
  consistency in the scripts.
* Confirmed alignment with the 90-second script's flow.

* Final adjustments to slide content and layout based on discussion,
    incorporating Evan's feedback on the Venn diagram and digital point clarity.

## 3. Presentation Rehearsals (Jola & Robel)

* Robel then presented his 90-second rehearsal. His explanation was fast but
  didn't end at the 90 seconds as well.
* Jola delivered her 90-second presentation rehearsal. Her delivery was clear,
  and her points about Access Barriers and Access Illusions were well
  articulated. She was slightly over time but did very well without
training(approx. 98 seconds).
* The overall flow and compelling nature of both presentations were noted.

## 4. Rehearsal Feedback & Topic Selection Discussion

* **General Feedback:** The team agreed that the narrative flow was strong, and
   the chosen key findings (Access Barriers, Access Illusions, Design
  Fragmentation, Policy-Practice Gap, Peer Networks) effectively convey the core
   message of exclusion "by design."

**Action Items:**

  **Jola & Robel:** Integrate a stronger, brief concluding statement to
  enhance their script and practice to make the 90 seconds.

## 5. Final README Repository Files Discussion

* The structure for the `README.md` was reviewed. It was confirmed that the
  final findings document has been drafted and should be integrated directly
  into the `README.md` rather than being a separate file to ensure quick access
   and comprehensive overview.

## 6. Task Division for Communications Deliverables/Artifacts

**Discussion:**

* Roles for finalizing communication artifacts were assigned to ensure timely
   completion by Karim.

## Next Steps

* **Final Submission:** All deliverables to be completed and ready for final
  submission by [Actual Final Submission Deadline].
* Additional extra rehearsal for the presenters if needed on the day after.
