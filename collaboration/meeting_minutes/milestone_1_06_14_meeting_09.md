## Meeting Objective

To finalize the research question through
collective brainstorming and peer review.
Each team member presented a proposed
research question related to our core
themes (Economic Inclusion), followed
by in-depth group discussions.

## Research Questions Presented

**Karim:**

- *To what extent have tailored
mentorship programs and business
development services enhanced the market
access of disabled entrepreneurs, leading
to measurable improvements in their
business performance over the last 10 years?*

**Omnia:**

- *What are the survival and growth
rates of women-led vs. PWD-led SMEs
in various sectors (e.g., food, fashion, tech)?*
- *How do mobile money adoption
patterns differ between male and female
SME owners, and what insights can
time-series analysis provide for
designing gender-inclusive financial products?*
- *Can predictive models identify
which environmental and support
factors most strongly correlate with
business longevity among entrepreneurs
with different types of disabilities?*
- *Which types of small businesses
are most likely to succeed based on
location, sector, and access to finance?*
- *How do education levels affect
access to financial products and employment?*
- *To what extent is saving in a bank
account more beneficial than
keeping savings in cash for small business owners?*

**Robel:**

- *How can local-language AI chatbots—deployed
via scalable platforms
(e.g., WhatsApp, Android, cloud APIs)—drive
measurable revenue growth for
microbusinesses in underserved
markets of Kenya, while creating
downstream monetization opportunities
for big tech through data, payments,
and ecosystem lock-in?*

**Muqadsa:**

- *How can machine learning models
identify which disabled micro-entrepreneurs
benefit most from virtual mentorship
programs, based on their digital
access, business stage, and psychosocial
readiness?*
- *How can interpretable machine
learning models predict the success
and digital inclusion of women-led
microenterprises based on mobile money
usage, digital access, and
rural-urban context?*

**Jola:**

- *How do mobile-based digital
(finance) platforms support or
exclude disabled entrepreneurs
in rural areas?*
- *How does access to finance and
training/mentorship affect
entrepreneurship experiences
for women with disabilities
in rural/urban areas?*
- *How do entrepreneurship experiences
differ for women with disabilities
in rural vs urban areas in terms
of access to finance and
training/mentorship?*

**Omer:**

- *How can artificial intelligence
be used to reduce traditional barriers
in accessing financing for entrepreneurs in Sudan?*

## Key Discussion Points

- Members reviewed each other's
questions through constructive feedback.
- The team explored commonalities
across questions, identifying
overlapping themes such as digital
access, financial barriers, and
mentorship impact.
- There was an in-depth conversation
around target populations (e.g., women,
disabled entrepreneurs, rural microbusinesses)
and how these groups are
underserved in current systems.
- The discussion emphasized the
importance of addressing real-world
problems and offering practical
solutions or policy insights.
- The team considered potential
methodologies, including:
  - Interpretable machine learning
  - Contextualized studies
(e.g., by gender, geography, or disability)

**Consensus was reached on the need for a research question that is:**

- Clearly scoped
- Grounded in real-world challenges
- Practically implementable with available data

## Conclusion & Next Steps

After a 4-hour session, the
team aligned on a shared core inquiry:

## Agreed Research Direction

> How can inclusive digital tools
(e.g., AI, mobile platforms, mentorship models)
support the growth and financial
access of underserved entrepreneurs,
especially women and people with disabilities?

Rather than selecting from unrelated
topics, the group agreed that the
vote will focus on choosing the most
effective framing and analytical
approach to this central question.
This may include differences in
methodology, population focus,
or implementation strategy.

---

## Action Items

- [ ] Create a shared voting
form listing all proposed framings/methods
- [ ] Finalize the chosen framing
of the research question and
document it clearly for submission
- [ ] Begin aligning research
sources, datasets, and
methodologies accordingly
