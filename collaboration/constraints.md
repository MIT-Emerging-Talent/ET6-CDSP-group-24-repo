# Project Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External Constraints

### 1. Time Zone Differences
**Impact**: Difficulty scheduling live meetings and coordinating work across different time zones.  
**Mitigation**: Use flexible meeting times, asynchronous communication tools (e.g., Slack, email), and record meetings for those who cannot attend live.

### 2. Family Responsibilities
**Impact**: Unpredictable availability due to personal or family commitments.  
**Mitigation**: Allow flexible deadlines and encourage early communication about availability changes.

### 3. Work Obligations
**Impact**: Conflict between project work and full-time job responsibilities.  
**Mitigation**: Prioritize tasks, break work into manageable parts, and distribute workload fairly.

### 4. Studying for Exams
**Impact**: Reduced participation during exam periods.  
**Mitigation**: Adjust project timelines to accommodate exam schedules.

### 5. Limited Internet Access
**Impact**: Difficulty accessing resources and participating in live online meetings due to poor or unstable internet connection.  
**Mitigation**: Provide downloadable project materials ahead of time; use alternative communication methods (e.g., phone, chat apps); record all meetings so members can watch them later when they have better access.

### 6. Device Issues
**Impact**: Delays or interruptions caused by hardware or software problems.  
**Mitigation**: Encourage regular backups, provide basic technical support guidelines, and have contingency plans.


## Internal Constraints : Involuntary

  #### 1. Stress from Balancing Multiple Responsibilities
**Impact**: Reduced productivity and risk of burnout.  
**Mitigation**: Promote time management best practices, encourage breaks, and facilitate peer support.

#### 2. Tendency to Take Over Leadership
**Impact**: May cause frustration among team members.  
**Mitigation**: Define clear roles, encourage open feedback, and establish communication norms.

#### 3. Lack of Coding Experience
**Impact**: Delays in completing technical tasks.  
**Mitigation**: Provide learning resources and mentorship, assign tasks according to skill levels, and encourage members to seek help from those with coding experience.

## Summary

Documenting constraints alongside clear mitigation strategies increases transparency, reduces risks, and helps manage time and resources efficiently. It supports team satisfaction and fosters collaboration, improving the chances of project success.
