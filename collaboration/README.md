consistent, and effective.

## Key Documents & Sections

Here you'll find essential information about how our team operates:

* ### [Group Norms](#group-norms-1)

    This section outlines our expectations for team interactions. It covers
    our shared agreements on how we work together effectively.

* ### [Communication](./communication.md)

    This document outlines our established communication protocols for team
    interactions.

* ### [Project Constraints](./constraints.md)

    This file details the defined constraints and limitations of our project.
    Understanding these boundaries helps us keep our scope focused and our
    efforts aligned with project requirements and resources.

* ### [Learning Goals](./learning_goals.md)

    Here you can find the individual and collective learning goals for our
    team throughout the duration of the project. These goals guide our skill
    development and knowledge acquisition.

* ### [Meeting Minutes](./meeting_minutes/)

    This directory contains the detailed records of our team meetings. Each
    file captures discussions, decisions, action items, and attendees for
    specific sessions.

    **Meeting Minutes Naming Convention:**
    Files in the `meeting_minutes` directory follow a consistent naming
    convention to ensure easy traceability and organization:

    `milestone_[X]_[MM]_[DD]_meeting_[YY].md`

  * `milestone_[X]`: Refers to the project's specific milestone number
  (e.g., `milestone_1` for Milestone 1).
  * `[MM]`: Represents the two-digit month of the meeting (e.g., `06` for June).
  * `[DD]`: Represents the two-digit day of the meeting (e.g., `08` for the 8th).
  * `meeting_[YY]`: Represents a sequential meeting number across the entire
  * project (e.g., `meeting_04`).

    *Example: `milestone_1_06_08_meeting_04.md` means the 4th project meeting,
    held on June 8th, related to Milestone 1.*

* ### [Retrospectives](./retrospectives/)

    This directory holds our retrospective documents for each project milestone.
    These reflections help us evaluate our processes, identify successes,
    acknowledge challenges, and determine actionable improvements for continuous
    team growth and project efficiency.

* ### [General Guide](./guide/)

    This guide provides an overview or additional context for navigating the
    `collaboration` directory and its contents.
